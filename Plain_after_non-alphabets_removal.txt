CHARLES NODIER    AS A WRITER  NODIER PERHAPS DESERVES THE FIRST RANK AMONG CONTEMPORARY AUTHORS  HIS STYLE IS A MODEL OF CLARITY  OF SUSTAINED ELEGANCE AND ABOVE ALL OF EXCESSIVE PURITY  IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE MORE CORRECTION AND AT THE SAME TIME MORE EASY TO BEND TO ALL SOUNDS  TO MEET ALL NEEDS OF PASSION  BY TURNS SEVERE  SAD  PLEASANT  TERRIBLE  LIGHT  IT IS A STYLE THAT CANNOT BE STUDIED WITH TOO MUCH CARE AND ATTENTION  NODIER HAS A WAY OF HIS OWN  NODIER MADE SCHOOL  AND PUPILS AND PUPILS WORTHY OF HIM  AND WHOM THE PUBLIC LOVES  KNOWS  ESTEEM  AND THAT WE WILL NOT NAME HERE  FOR THE SAKE OF THE MODESTY OF THE MASTER FIRST OF ALL  AND PERHAPS ALSO OF HIS PUPILS      JULES JANIN     EXTRACT FROM A NOTICE OF THE      EDITION       JEAN SBOGAR   JEAN SBOGAR     THE PEOPLE I KNOW WOULD PROBABLY EXEMPT ME WITHOUT SORROW TO DECLARE THAT THIS NEW EDITION OF A FEW WEAK WORKS DEEPLY FORGOTTEN BY THE PUBLIC IS NOT A VANITY SPECULATION  AGE IS ADVANCING FOR ME  BUT I AM STILL FAR FROM THAT EPOCH OF HAPPY OBLIVION WHEN OLD AGE  RETURNED TO CHILDREN S GAMES  PLAYFUL RATTLES WHICH AMUSED THE CRADLE  THIS LATE PUBLICATION IS THE SIMPLE EFFECT OF A CONVENIENCE OF BOOKSTORE  AND THE REASONS I HAVE FOR DESIRING ITS SUCCESS HAVE NO RELATION TO THE CLAIMS OF TALENT AND THE EXPECTATIONS OF GLORY    AFTER THESE ORATORICAL PRECAUTIONS OF A PRUDENT MODESTY WHICH LEAVES PERHAPS PIERCE SOME PRIDE  LIKE THE HOLES IN THE MANTLE OF A PHILOSOPHER  WILL I BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK OF THESE RESURRECTED WRITINGS BY THE PRESS AS IF THEY STILL REALLY EXISTED IN THE MEMORY OF THEIR FORMER READERS  WHY NOT  IF HE COMES OUT OF THIS COMPLACENT RETURN OF THE MIND OF A WRITER TO THE NOTHINGS OF HIS YOUTH  A SMALL NUMBER OF ANECDOTES THAT ARE WORTH READING WHEN YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO  IN THIS BROADCAST TIME UNIVERSAL  THE AUTHORS OF MEMOIRES ET DE SOUVENIRS OFTEN THE OCCASION TO NOTICE THAT HE ATTACHED SOME CHARM TO PERSONALITY  AND THE MIND  TIRED OF IMMENSE EMOTIONS  WILLINGLY TOOK REFUGE IN THE NARROW SPHERE OF THE SMALL INDIVIDUAL IMPRESSIONS  BESIDES THESE PREFACES ARE MADE FOR THOSE WHO READ MY NOVELS AND WILLING  I THINK  TO MYSELF FORGIVE MY PREFACES    I WILL NOT SAY WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES MADE ME DECIDE TO PUBLISH IN      THE NOVEL BY JEAN SBOGAR  DRAFTED IN      AT THE PLACES THAT INSPIRED  IT WILL SUFFICE FOR ME TO NOTE IN PASSING THAT I WAS ENTERING THEN IN A VERY SERIOUS CAREER WHERE I TOOK ONLY ONE STEP  AND THAT THIS CONSIDERATION FORBADE ME TO ATTACH MY NAME TO FRONTISPIECE  JEAN SBOGAR S POLICY WOULD INDEED HAVE BEEN A BAD RECOMMENDATION FOR THE MAN WHO WAS GOING TO PROFESS POLITICAL SCIENCE IN THE LITTLE TARTANE  AND NOBODY WILL BE SURPRISED THAT THE AUTHOR  RECOGNIZED DESPITE HIS PRECAUTIONS  WAS THERE BLACKLISTED LIKE HIS BOOK  WE CAN JUDGE THE REST BY THE TIMELINESS OF THIS PUBLICATION IN THE HIGH SPIRIT OF CONVENIENCE AND OF APTITUDE TO THE INTERESTED CONCESSIONS WHICH DIRECTED ME IN ALL THE BIG BUSINESS OF MY LIFE    THE SUCCESS COMPENSATED ME A LITTLE THIS TIME FOR THE VICISSITUDES OF FAVOR  THE ANONYMOUS BROUGHT ME LUCK IN THE NEWSPAPERS WHERE WE HAVE ALWAYS QUITE WILLINGLY TOLERATED THE PASSING VOGUE OF A WRITING AGAIN  WHEN IT DOES NOT AFFECT A REPUTATION  THE IMPRESSION OF A MOMENT THAT THIS TRIFLE PRODUCED WAS MOREOVER VERY FOREIGN TO THE INTRINSIC MERIT OF THE BOOK  SHE RESULTED FROM THE GENERAL DISPOSITION OF MINDS THAT THE EVENTS OF PREVIOUS YEARS HAD GRADUALLY BROUGHT BACK TO DOCTRINES OF LIBERTY  AND THE CHARACTER OF MY HERO HAD ALLOWED TO BRING TO THEIR LAST EXPRESSION THE THEORIES OF WHICH I AM FAR FROM FULLY ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY  SHE WAS SERIOUS THEN  AND WOULD PERHAPS BE MORE SERIOUS TODAY IF THE PROLETARIANS READ NOVELS  I AM HAPPY TO THINK THAT PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION HAVE NOT YET COME TO THIS  AND THAT THE REVERIES OF MY GRACCHUS DE SPALATO WILL NO LONGER EXERCISE INFLUENCE UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE ON LEARNED SOCIETIES THAT THOSE OF THE GOD THAT WE ADORED IN THE RUE TAITBOUT    HOWEVER  MY TWO VOLUME BROCHURE MUST HAVE CARRIED SOME IMPRINT OF A MAN S CHARACTER  SINCE ONLY ONE MAN WAS FOUND TO WHOM TO ATTRIBUTE IT  AND THAT IT WAS  I HUMBLY APOLOGIZE TO HIS NOBLE MEMORY  MY ILLUSTRIOUS FRIEND BENJAMIN CONSTANT  OF JOURNALISTS WHO BELIEVED THEMSELVES BETTER INFORMED  AND WHOM I HAD DECEIVED DO NOT KNOW WHAT MIXTURE OF ASCETICISM OF LOVE AND PHILANTHROPY DESPERATE WHO MERGE INTO THIS BLUETTE  ACCUSED MME  OF KRUDENER  WHO WAS NOT A MAN  AND WHO WAS BEGINNING TO MORE SEX  I DID NOT INTERVENE IN THIS FIGHT WHICH COULD NOT LAST LONG  ADOLPHE AND VALERIE ANSWERED FOR THEIR AUTHORS    HERE I AM AT THE STORY OF THE MOST BRILLIANT OF MY SUCCESSES  AND I CAN HARDLY BE WRONG  BECAUSE I AM NOT DAZZLED BY THE AMOUNT  I M TELLING FACTS  AND THAT S ENOUGH TO PUT MY MIND HUMILITY AT EASE  I THINK I SAID SOMEWHERE THAT PREFACE WAS A WORK OF PRIDE  I REPEAT IT WILLINGLY  INNOCENT PRIDE  MOREOVER  AND ALMOST WORTHY OF A TENDER COMPASSION  LET HIM WHO RELIES ON THE SOUND OF A LITTLE BOOK  AND WHICH LASTS JUST LONG ENOUGH TO ESCORT HIM FROM THE STORE UNDER THE PESTLE  WHILE WAITING FOR IT TO UNDERGO A NEW METAMORPHOSIS IN THE MOLDS OF THE CARD MAKER  OLD MARIE DE GOURNAY  WORTHY DAUGHTER ALLIANCE OF MONTAIGNE  WONDERFULLY EXPRESSED MY THOUGHTS IN A SUBLIME VERSE THAT WOULD APPEAL TO OUR YOUNG AND BRILLIANT POETS   MAN IS THE SHADOW OF A DREAM  AND HIS WORK IS HIS SHADOW    IN TRUTH  JEAN SBOGAR IS ONLY MY SHADOW  AT MOST  WHERE I AM GREATLY MISTAKEN ABOUT MY POOR PLACE IN THE SUN    THE NAME OF THE AUTHOR OF JEAN SBOGAR RETURNED TO PARIS FROM SAINT HELENA  IT S NOT THE LONGEST OF MY TRAVELS  BUT IT S THE ODYSSEY OF MY FAME  WE WILL NEVER CATCH HER FLYING SO FAR  NAPOLEON  WHOSE LITERARY TASTE WAS NOT OF COURSE  WITNESS HIS PREDILECTION FOR MACPHERSON S EPIC DECEPTIONS  AND FOR THE HOMERIC PASTICHE OF LUCE DE LANCIVAL  TOOK CARE OF JEAN SBOGAR FOR TWO DAYS  THE ENGLISH NEWSPAPERS ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD SPENT A NIGHT READING IT  AND A FEW HOURS WRITING IT DOWN ON A COPY WHICH HAS REMAINED  AS I HAVE OFTEN BEEN TOLD  IN HANDS OF GENERAL GOURGAUD  AS FOR THE MEMORY OF MY NAME  IT DOES WOULD NOT BE QUITE NECESSARY TO ASSUME HE HAD IT PRESERVED  TO ATTRIBUTE TO HIM THE POWER OF MEMORY OF CAESAR  WHO CALLED  EACH BY HIS OWN  THE FORTY THOUSAND SOLDIERS OF WHOM HE WAS ACCOMPANIED TO THE PLAINS OF PHARSALIA  IF NAPOLEON BELIEVED REALLY  AS HE DICTATED TO HIS CHRONICLERS  THAT HE BE MADE  UNDER HIS REIGN  THAT TWENTY SIX ARRESTS WITHOUT WARRANT JUDICIAL AND WITHOUT NUTS  ON LETTERS OF SEAL BEARING ITS IMPERIAL SIGNATURE  I COULD WELL HAVE BEEN THERE  THIS PECULIARITY IS EXPLAINED  FORTUNATELY  IN AN EVEN MORE NATURAL  BY A VERY SIMPLE FACT  ONE OF NAPOLEON S FRIENDS  SAINT HELENA  HAD BEEN MINE  IN PARIS  IN       AND HE KNEW THE STORY OF JEAN SBOGAR  IN A TIME WHEN I DID NOT THINK OF FINISH IT OFF  I AM PROUD  BUT I AM SINCERE  SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE FLAPS MUCH OF THE ILLUSTRATION THAT WOULD RESULT FOR ME TO HAVE BEEN GUESSED BY NAPOLEON  AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN UP WILLINGLY TO THIS EQUIVOCAL TITLE OF GLORY  IF I HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO HARM MY EDITOR    BE THAT AS IT MAY  THIS APOSTILLE  COMING FROM HIGH PLACES  EXCITED PROBABLY A MOMENT OF RUMOR IN THE EDITORIAL OFFICE OF BONAPARTIST SOAP OPERAS IN WHICH I DID NOT ENJOY A GREAT CREDIT  I GUESS IT WAS AT FIRST A PRETTY SERIOUS QUESTION THAT TO KNOW IF THE AUTHOR OF JEAN SBOGAR HAD GAINED SOME THING IN CAPACITY  OR IF NAPOLEON HAD FALLEN IN CHILDHOOD  LIKE HIM WAS NOT MY DESTINY TO BE WEIGHED IN SUCH A SCALE  TODAY I HAVE SOME MODESTY TO SAY IT  WHILE THERE REFLECTIVE  THE EDITORS WHO WERE CLEVER PEOPLE  AND WHO HAVE SINCE PROVED IT SUPERBLY  AN AVERAGE PARTY AGREED  IT WAS DECIDED THAT NOTHING IS INVENTED IN LITERATURE  WHICH IS ALL IN FACT MY OPINION  THAT THIS IS MORE ESPECIALLY FORBIDDEN THAN NO ONE TO WRITERS WHO ARE NOT FROM THE ACADEMY  WHICH I ADMIT NOT SO EXCLUSIVELY  AND THAT ANY MAN WHO HAD DARED TO COMPOSE JEAN SBOGAR WOULD BE CONVINCED OF HAVING STOLEN IT  THIS RESOLUTION PASSED  I MUST SAY  UNANIMOUSLY  THE KING S ATTORNEY DID NOT INFORM  HE HAD A GOOD GAME  HOWEVER    BYRON JUST APPEARED  IN FRENCH  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DISCUSSION  AND WE SUDDENLY REALIZED  SO DEEP ARE THE INSIGHTS OF MALICE  WHICH MY UNFORTUNATE THIEF HAD BEEN STOLEN FROM THE CORSAIR  IT IS TRUE THAT JEAN SBOGAR HAD FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OLDER THAN ITS SENIOR INVENTOR  BUT WE DON T LOOK AT IT SO CLOSE WHEN ARGUING WITH THE LAMB  CRITICISM HAS A GOOD SIDE  I READ BYRON  WHOM I BARELY KNEW TO HAVE IT HEARD MADAME DE STAEL NAMED TWO OR THREE TIMES  I READ IT OFTEN SINCE WITH AN ADMIRATION FOR WHICH HE IS NOT INDEBTED TO MY GRATITUDE  THE CORSAIR LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF THINGS LIKE EVERYTHING THAT WILL BE WRITTEN BY THE END OF THE CENTURIES  HE HAD ME WAS IMPOSSIBLE  AND I COMPLIMENT BYRON ON HIM FIND THE SLIGHTEST CONNECTION WITH JEAN SBOGAR  CERTAINLY  THIS WAS NOT THE CASE TO SAY  IN ANY SENSE POSSIBLE  THAT FINE MINDS MEET  IF I HAD BEEN BYRON I WOULD HAVE FILED A COMPLAINT  BYRON  WHO KNEW FRENCH PRECISELY AS I KNOW ENGLISH  DID NOT COMPLAIN  HE DIED WITHOUT HAVING OPEN NEITHER JEAN SBOGAR  NOR THE NEWSPAPERS WHERE IT IS QUESTION  AND THAT IS NOT WHAT HE DIED OF    I DIDN T COMPLAIN EITHER  THE BIBLIOGRAPHY HAD ME WELL SOME OBLIGATIONS  I HAD NEVER SERIOUSLY CARED THAT OF HER  AND SINCE IT IS HER BUSINESS TO CLARIFY THE DATES AND RIGHT LITERARY WRONGS  I HOPED SHE WOULD AVENGE ME  IF EVER  BIBLIOGRAPHY AND I  WE ARRIVE SIDE BY SIDE BEFORE POSTERITY  IT WAS THEN THAT WAS PRINTED  ON A BEAUTIFUL PAPER  AND DECORATED WITH THE ANCHOR FRONTISPIECE SCIENTIST FROM ALDES  THE EXCELLENT LIBRARY CATALOG OF AN AMATEUR  THE LEARNED AND INGENIOUS AUTHOR WAS CAREFUL NOT TO LET ME REPROACH FOR STEALING BYRON  HE WAS TOO STRONG FOR THAT ON THE SYNCHRONISM OF BOOKS  AND HE ESTIMATED AT THEIR PRICE THESE NONSENSE  GOOD AT MOST FOR THE SCHOLARSHIP OF A NEWSPAPER  BUT AFTER HAVING DONE JUSTICE TO THIS BITTER SWEET CONTROVERSY  TO WHICH HE PROBABLY FORGOT THAT I HAD NOT COMPETED  HE TOLD ME THIEF IN HIS CAPACITY AS JUROR CRITIC  THERE WAS ONLY THE NAME OF THE STOLE FROM CHANGED  YOU TELL ME THIEVES DON T KNOW ALWAYS THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE THEY STEAL  BUT YOU MIGHT BE AS EMBARRASSED AS I AM IF YOU WERE ACCUSED OF STEALING ZCHOCKE    THIS NOTE MUCH MORE BITTERSWEET  TO PUT IT MILDLY BITTER  THAT MY CONTROVERSY  WHICH I HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF  SANK INTO CRUEL CONSTERNATION  I FOUND MYSELF REACHED AND CONVINCED  IN A BOOK ENDOWED WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF LIFE  OF THE CRIME OF HAVING STOLE ZCHOCKE  I WHO WOULD NOT WANT TO STEAL ANYONE IN THE WORLD  EVEN ZCHOCKE  I WHO DID NOT KNOW ZCHOCKE  ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN TRANSLATED BY LAMARTELI RE  AND THAT IT WAS FOUND FROM THE SAID TRANSLATION OF SAID ZCHOCKE A VELLUM PAPER COPY WITH BLUE MOROCCO BACK IN THE LIBRARY OF M  RENOUARD  ME WHO WAS NOT WORTHY OF TO KNOW ZCHOCKE IN       SINCE I DID NOT KNOW BYRON  I WENT EVERYWHERE TO ASK FOR NEWS OF ZCHOCKE  TO THE DEVIL WHO HAD YES SPEAK OF ZCHOCKE  I WAS FINALLY STARTING TO PERSUADE MYSELF THAT ZCHOCKE S PLAY ONLY EXISTED IN ONE COPY  WHICH HELD ITS PLACE WITH M  RENOUARD  AMONG SO MANY OTHER PRECIOUS RARITIES  WHEN MY GOOD FRIEND  M  DE PIXERECOURT  TOLD ME THAT ZCHOCKE WAS INDEED THE AUTHOR OF A DRAMA WHICH HAD NO RELATIONSHIP WITH JEAN SBOGAR  AND OF WHICH HE HAD COMPOSED A MELODRAMA THAT WAS A HUNDRED TIMES BETTER THAN JEAN SBOGAR AND THE DRAMA FROM ZCHOCKE  I COULDN T BELIEVE IT  BUT I DIDN T WANT TO TO JUDGE THAT PIECES IN HAND  SO MUCH I HAD AT HEART  IN MY INNOCENCE LITERARY  NOT TO HAVE PLUNDERED ZCHOCKE    I FINALLY FIND HIM  WHAT HUMILIATION  GREAT GOD  FIRST  MY HERO IS CALLED JEAN SBOGAR  THAT OF ZCHOCKE  ABELINO  AND MY LEARNED COLLEAGUE AT THE OLD CELTIC ACADEMY  ELOI JOHANNEAU  WILL PROVE TO YOU WHEN YOU WANT IT IS LITERALLY THE SAME THING  SECOND  ABELINO IS A GREAT LORD WHO MAKES HIMSELF PASS FOR A BANDIT  AND JEAN SBOGAR A BANDIT WHO PRETENDS FOR A GREAT LORD  PLAGIARISM BECOMES SENSITIVE  THIRD  ABELINO IS MARRIED TO THE RICHEST HEIRESS OF THE REPUBLIC  AND JEAN SBOGAR REFUSES TO MARRY THE YOUNG GIRL WHOM HE LOVES  FOR FEAR OF STAINING HER WITH HIS INFAMY  THEFT IS BLATANT  FOURTH  ABELINO SAVES HIS COUNTRY BY BETRAYING THE FAITH HE SWORE TO THIEVES  AND JEAN SBOGAR  WHO DID NOT WEAR HIS SEEN THAT AT LIBERTY OR ON THE SCAFFOLD  MARCH TO DEATH WITH ITS COMPANIONS  HERE THE EFFRONTERY OF THE THEFT GOES AS FAR AS IMPUDENCE  FINALLY THE TWO ACTIONS TAKE PLACE IN VENICE  WHERE WE HAD NEVER HAD THE IDEA OF   PLACING ANOTHER ROMANTIC ACTION  AND IT IS  FOR THIS TIMES  AS IF YOU WERE TAKING MY HAND IN ZCHOCKE S POCKET    I AM VERY SENSITIVE TO THAT PART OF LITERARY CRITICISM WHICH INVOLVES MORAL ISSUES  I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH ZCHOCKE  BUT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT EVERYONE COULD SAY IN ME SEEING PASS  HERE IS THE PLAGIARIST OF ZCHOCKE  I HAD LEARNED THAT ZCHOCKE WAS ONE OF THOSE EMINENT TALENTS THAT YOU DON T MEET OFTEN ON THE ROAD TO REPUTATIONS  AND ON THAT ROAD I WAS SURE OF MY ALIBI  BUT THAT DID NOT REASSURE ME  I HAD VISIONS OF ZCHOCKE AND ABELINO  I HAD NIGHTMARES OF ABELINO AND ZCHOCKE  I MADE A BIG ILLNESS FROM WHICH I WAS ONLY SAVED BY THE FEELING OF MY VIRTUE  I HELD INDEED A GREAT CONSOLATION IN STORE IN THE FORUM INSIDE MY UNJUSTLY SUSPECTED CONSCIENCE  IS THAT I HAD NOT NEEDED TO TAKE JEAN SBOGAR FROM ANYONE  SINCE I RANDOMLY OWED THE LITTLE ENVIED ADVANTAGE  TO ALL APPEARANCES OF TO HAVE KNOWN HIM RATHER PARTICULARLY    WHILE I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT  SOMETHING VERY STRANGE HAPPENED   IS THAT THEY FORGOT MY BOOK AS COMPLETELY AS IF IT HAD NOT NEVER APPEARED  I HAD TO RESOLVE TO KEEP MY DEFENSE FOR THE THIRD EDITION  TODAY  JEAN SBOGAR IS BACK  AND HE IT MAY BE A QUESTION UNTIL TOMORROW  I SEE MYSELF OBLIGED TO DECLARE THAT NO ONE IN THE WORLD HAS ANY PLAGIARISM TO IMPUTE TO ME IN THIS AFFAIR  IF NOT  PERHAPS  THE CLERK OF THE LAYBACH IN CARNIOLA  THE HONEST M  REPISITCH  WHO WAS KIND ENOUGH TO GIVE IN TIME  THE DOCUMENTS OF THE PROCEDURE IN COMMUNICATION IN ORDER TO CORRECT SOME ENSLAVED GERMANISMS OF WHICH HE FEARED THAT HE HAD SOMETIMES BEEN GUILTY IN THE HEAT OF WRITING  I FURTHER PROTEST THAT ALL I HAVE TAKEN IN HIS FILE IS REDUCED TO CERTAIN FACTS THAT I COULD NOT HAVE BETTER TO INVENT  WHEN I WOULD HAVE BEEN ZCHOCKE  AND THERE IS NOTHING IN MY HEART THAT REPROACHES ME FOR HAVING WRONGED HIM WITH JUST ONE FORMS OF HIS STYLE  THIS GOOD MR  REPISITCH BEING VERY STUBBORN ON THE CLASSIC OF THE GRAFT  WHICH IS NOT THAT OF THE NOVEL    WE WILL TELL YOU IN ISTRIA  CROATIA  DALMATIA  WHEN YOU TAKE THE TROUBLE TO EXTRACT INFORMATION THAT I DO NOT HAVE MADE A GREAT EFFORT OF MIND TO INVENT THE NAME OF JEAN SBOGAR  MY MAIN CHARACTER WAS CALLED OR WAS CALLED JEAN SBOGAR  AND I PRESUME THAT THE LITTLE CHILDREN OF THE GULF OF TRIESTE WOULD ATTEST IT TO YOU AS WELL AS I DID  BECAUSE THE NAMES OF LEADERS OF THIEVES HAS THE SAME PRIVILEGE AS THAT OF CONQUERORS   WE REMEMBER THEM EVERYWHERE THEY WENT  THE COURT OF JUSTICE WHICH CONDEMNED IT WAS CHAIRED BY M  LE COMTE SPALATIN  THE JUDGES THAT I REMEMBER WERE M  DE KOUPFERSCHEIN AND M  DE GISCELON  THE HIGH FUNCTIONS OF THE PROSECUTION WERE EXERCISED WITH ALL THE POWER OF A YOUNG AND PRECIOUS TALENT  BY M  DESCLAUX  IMPERIAL ATTORNEY GENERAL  WHO NOW HOLDS A PLACE DISTINGUISHED AMONG THE LAWYERS OF THE COURT OF CASSATION  AND WHO WOULD GLADLY DEFEND  IF I NEEDED HIS HELP LAST SPRING  FROM THE WICKED IMPUTATION OF HAVING TAKEN JEAN SBOGAR IN A ZCHOCKE TRAGEDY  HE KNOWS I FOUND HIM READY MADE    HOWEVER  JEAN SBOGAR WAS ONLY NOTICED BY THE TRIBUNAL BY THIS MORE THAN HUMAN EXPRESSION OF PHYSIOGNOMY WHICH WAS THE CHARACTERISTIC OF HIS REPORT  AND WHICH MADE HIM HOLD THE EXPRESSION OF SCHILLER  THE ANGEL  THE DEVIL AND THE GOD  THE MORAL INTEREST OF HIS DEFENSE WAS TO DIE UNDER THE NAME OBSCURE OF A SIMPLE MORLAQUE ADVENTURER  BY EVADING ANY IDENTITY WITH THE DAZZLING MENECHISM WHOSE DISHONOR WAS TO OFFEND ALL HIS FRIENDSHIPS AND WITHER ALL HIS LOVES  HE     NOT ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS OF ITS JUDGES ONLY IN THE AFFIRMATIVE OR NEGATIVE SLAVE  AND IF HE ALMOST BETRAYED HIMSELF  IT WAS ONLY THE READING OF THE CAPITAL JUDGMENT  PRONOUNCED IN FRENCH  WHICH ONLY A VULGAR BANDIT STRUCK IN HIM  THE NIGHT WAS ADVANCING TO THE POINT THAT THEY HAD JUST BEEN OBLIGED TO BRING TORCHES  I WAS STANDING AGAINST HIS BENCH  I NOTICED HE WAS LISTENING TO THIS LANGUAGE HE HAD REFUSED TO UNDERSTAND  AND THAT A LOOK OF JOY LIT UP HIS EYES  WHEN HE COULD RECOGNIZE BY THE TEXT OF THE CONVICTION THAT SHE HAD EXCLUDED THE FACTS RELATING TO HER PSEUDONYMIES FROM GERMANY AND ITALY  THIS RADIANT GAZE OF HAPPINESS  MAYBE I INTERCEPTED IT  BECAUSE IT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION TO THE PARQUET FLOOR  THAT S WHY I WROTE A SHORT STORY CALLED JOHN SBOGAR  I COULD HAVE STUCK  FOR MY JUSTIFICATION  TO THESE SCRAPS OF THE BIOGRAPHY OF A THIEF  WHO LEFT SOME REMEMBRANCE OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND LIVING WITNESSES  BUT MY LOVE FOR THE ANECDOTE IS ABLE TO TAKE ME FURTHER  IF YOU WANT ME TO FOLLOW  AND I AM ALL THE MORE WILLING TO DO SO AS THE PUBLIC I MIGHT WORRY ABOUT THE DIMENSION OF JEAN SBOGAR  IN WHICH HE HAS THE RIGHT TO DEMAND A REASONABLE VOLUME  IT IS TRUE THAT I DIDN T PROMISE HIM SO MUCH    THE CONVICTION OF JEAN SBOGAR WAS A LEGAL FACT TO WHICH HE DID NOT LACKED THAT THE MATERIAL SANCTION OF AN EXECUTION OF BLOOD  BUT THE FLIRTATIOUS CEREMONIAL OF OUR PHILANTHROPIC CODES REQUIRED A UNKNOWN DEVICE IN THE COUNTRY  IT WAS THEREFORE NECESSARY THAT JEAN SBOGAR RESIGNED TO IMPLORING IN HIS DUNGEON ON THE DAY OF DELIVERANCE WHEN A CARPENTER OF THE CITY OF THE ARGONAUTS WOULD MANAGE TO RAISE ON TRESTLES TWO LONG PARALLEL POSTS  AND WHERE THE TOOL MAKER CARNIOLAN WOULD AGREE TO FIT A KNIFE SUITABLE FOR CUTTING A MAN S HEAD  THE TRIALS WERE SO AWKWARD AND SO MISERABLE  THAT THEY PROBABLY FORCED STATESMEN TO DESPAIR OF CIVILIZATION OF ILLYRIA  WHAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT WE LEFT HER A FEW MONTHS LATER  WITH LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN HER PERFECTIBILITY OF CONQUERED NATIONS  WE DIDN T EVEN HAVE HIM LEFT THE GUILLOTINE    JEAN SBOGAR  FREED BY A JUDGMENT IN THE FORM OF THE ONLY ANXIETY THAT WOULD HAVE DISTURBED HIS SLEEP  BECAME MORE COMMUNICATIVE  AND OPENED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY TO THE MEN IN WHOM HE BELIEVED BE ABLE TO PLACE SOME FAITH  ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY OFFERED HIM THE GUARANTEE UNTIL THEN INVIOLATE OF THE OATHS OF CARBONARISM  IT IS WHILE I SAW IT TWO OR THREE TIMES  MUCH HIGHER THAN JEAN SBOGAR WHOM I TRIED TO PAINT  AND PERHAPS AT ALL TYPES OF THE SAME CHARACTER OFFERED BY THE NOVEL AND POETRY  SINCE CAPTAIN LAROQUE DE CERVANTES  TO CHARLES MOOR DES THIEVES  HE SPOKE ELEGANTLY  AND OFTEN ELOQUENTLY  THE FRENCH  ITALIAN  GERMAN  MODERN GREEK  AND MOST OF SLAVIC DIALECTS  SOME OF THE VERY HETERODOX SENTENCES IN POLITICS  OF WHICH I COMPOSED HIS TABLETS  ARE TAKEN FROM HIS CONVERSATION WITH SCRUPULOUS LITERALITY  I WILL ADD ONLY A FEW DETAILS TO HIS PORTRAIT FOR READERS WHO WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING  AND WHO DO NOT FORGIVE THE NEW MOVE AWAY FROM THE HISTORIAN IN THE SMALLEST PARTICULARITIES  BUT WE CANNOT SATISFY ALL TASTES  HAVEN T I HAD SOME ARGUING WITH WOMEN FOR LEAVING HIM CURLS EARS    JEAN SBOGAR DID NOT HAVE THE HAIR OF THIS GOLDEN BLONDE WHO LENDS A PICTURESQUE BEAUTY MORE TO THE GRACEFUL HEADS OF THE NORTH AND THE WEST  THEY WERE ROUGHLY COPPER RED  COLOR HIGHLY ESTEEMED IN NORTHERN ITALY  BUT WHICH IS NOT PARIS  AND WHICH I WOULD HAVE ALL THE MORE DIFFICULTY IN MAKING UNDERSTOOD CHARM  THAT THE ONLY COMPARISON THAT HAS COME TO ME IS A SACRIFICE TO THE CONVENTIONS OF LANGUAGE  SHE DOES NOT EXPRESS THEIR SHADE WHICH VARIED WITH THE PLAY OF LIGHT OF ALL THE REFLECTIONS OF TEN METALS CONFUSED IN THE FURNACE  FROM THE MOMENT THEY BLAZE OVER  UNTIL THEY BLACKEN COOLED  WE COULD  HOWEVER  GET AN IDEA OF   THE WHIM OF COLORS OF THEIR THICK AND FLOATING TUFTS WHEN WE HAVE SEEN THE ERUPTION OF A VOLCANO FROM BEGINNING TO END  BY ONE SINGULAR ODDITY OF NATURE  HIS MUSTACHE AND BEARD THAT HE WEARING LONG IN THE DUNGEON WERE A BURNISHED STEEL BLACK    THE HORSE S HABIT HAD REMARKABLY ARCHED THE LEGS OF JEAN SBOGAR  BUT HIS BUST WAS SO WIDE  ESPECIALLY AT THE SHOULDERS  THAT WE WERE NOT SURPRISED THAT ITS SUPPORTS HAD BENT UNDER THE WEIGHT  ON THE CONTRARY  HIS NECK APPEARED EXTREMELY SLENDER TOWARDS THE LOW  PERHAPS BECAUSE OF ITS LENGTH  HE WAS JOKING WITH A HORRIBLE GAIETY ON THIS ADVANTAGE OF HIS CONFORMATION  AND THIS SCARY BANTER WAS SUCH THAT I PREFER TO LET IT GUESS THAN TO WRITE IT    THE REPORT COULD NOT HAVE FORGOTTEN THE WHITE HAND  DELICATE AND FEMININE BY JEAN SBOGAR  WHO CONTRASTED  IN TRUTH  WITH A EXTRAORDINARY WAY WITH THE REST OF ITS SLENDER FORMS  BUT STURDY AND ALMOST ATHLETIC  I HAVEN T SEEN A PRETTIER ONE   ONE WOULD HAVE JUDGED BY LOOKING AT HER THAT SHE WAS AT MOST CAPABLE TO ENDURE THE FOURTEEN JEWELS THAT ADORN HER ON THE DAY OF HER ARREST  WHICH WERE ESTIMATED AT EIGHTY THOUSAND FRANCS  AND WHICH  REVERENCE KEPT FOR THE EXPERT JEWELER  WERE WORTH PROBABLY MORE  WE WOULDN T HAVE SUSPECTED  IF WE HAD IT SEEN COMING OUT OF THE SLEEVE OF A VENETIAN DOMINO  THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO TO SUPPORT A SWORD AND  MUCH LESS  TO WIELD IT WITH DEXTERITY AT THE HEAD OF A SQUADRON  IT WOULD HOWEVER HAVE CRUMBLED  IF SHE HAD TAKEN THE TROUBLE  BARS  BOLTS  RAILINGS  IRON GATES    SOMETHING WOULD BE MISSING FROM THE PORTRAIT OF JEAN SBOGAR IF I DID NOT SKETCHED THE GREAT MORAL TRAIT  IT WAS A SORT OF MORGUE ROYAL WHICH MANIFESTED ITSELF IN ALL HER PERSON  IN HER PORT  IN HIS ATTITUDES  IN HIS SOVEREIGN GAZE  IN HIS DISDAINFUL SMILE  IN HIS HIGH  ABRUPT AND IMPERATIVE WORDS  BUT ABOVE ALL IN THE ROUGH AND THREATENING FOLD THAT IT ROLLED  DUG IN FURROWS  BROKE IN SHARP ANGLES  CROSSED  SO TO SPEAK  IN LIGHTNING BETWEEN HIS EYEBROWS AT THE SLIGHTEST CONTRADICTION  THIS FIERCE MANIFESTATION OF A DESPOTIC WILL WOULD HAVE MADE ME HORROR FROM THE HEIGHT OF A THRONE  BUT I CANNOT EXPRESS HOW MUCH I I FOUND IT SUBLIME ON THE STRAW OF THE CONDEMNED  BETWEEN THE SUBMISSIVE TURNKEY WHO SURROUNDED HIM LIKE CHAMBERLAINS  AND WHO RECEIVED AS GRACES THE ORDERS OF THE UNFORTUNATE THAT THE JUSTICE HAD JUST GIVEN TO THE EXECUTIONER    ONE NIGHT THE PRISON DOORS WERE OPENED BY AN EVENT FORCE MAJEURE  COMPLETELY FOREIGN TO JEAN SBOGAR AND HIS TROOP  AND WHICH I WILL PERHAPS TELL ELSEWHERE IF THE OCCASION ARISES PRESENT  OR IF YOU DON T GET BORED OF HEARING ME TELL  ALL PRISONERS FLED  THE CONCIERGE DISAPPEARED  ITS EMPLOYEES ARE DISPERSED  AT SUNRISE ALL THE EXITS WERE FREE  JEAN SBOGAR WAS THE LAST TO GO OUT AND PUT AN OLD WOMAN TO SAFETY  THE JUDGMENT HAD STRUCK WITH HIM  AND THAT THE SYSTEM OF THE PROSECUTION INTRODUCED AS HIS MOTHER  WENT TO PICK UP HIS HORSE AT AN INN FROM THE SUBURB OF CRACAW WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIM  GAVE HIM OATS  TOOK THE ROAD TO ISTRIA  AND SLEPT IN THE EVENING AT ADELSBERG  TWO DAYS LATER  HE WAS ENVELOPED IN THE ANCIENT HOVEL OF DUINO  AND THE REST WENT AS I SAID  OR SO  BECAUSE I DID NOT THINK THAT THE NOVEL WAS HELD TO THE ACCURACY OF THE GAZETTE  AND ANYONE WHO UNDERSTANDS THIS KIND OF COMPOSITION WILL NOT BE SURPRISED POINT THAT I DELETED THE SUPERABUNDANT EPISODE OF LAYBACH  DESPITE ITS TWIST  TO ARRIVE MORE QUICKLY AT THE DENOUEMENT OF MANTUA  THE JEAN SBOGAR DIED ON THE SCAFFOLD WHICH HAD DRUNK  IT IS SAID  IN SIX MONTHS  THE BLOOD OF A THOUSAND OF HIS COMPANIONS  SOMETHING DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE AND THAT I DO NOT GUARANTEE  IN MANTUA  NEVER CARPENTERS NOR TOOL MAKERS HAD FAILED IN THE CALL OF AUTHORITY  WHEN HE IT WAS ABOUT PREPARATIONS FOR AN ORDEAL  THE OFFICIAL INSTRUMENT OF LEGAL ASSASSINATION WAS PRESERVED THERE BY TRADITION  IMMEMORIAL  AS IN MOST OF THE PENINSULA ITALICS  WHICH IS SUFFICIENTLY PROVEN TO FANS OF MONUMENTS AND HUMANITIES OF THE MIDDLE AGES  BY ONE OF THE ADMIRABLE PRINTS WITH WHICH BONASONE ENRICHED THE TIRESOME IN BOLOGNA IN      EMBLEMS OF THE NOBLE ACHILLES BOCCHIUS  AND THAT BIBLIOMANIACS LOOK LITTLE IN THE COPIES RETOUCHED IN      BY AUGUSTIN CARRACHE  PERFECTIBILITY WILL BE FINE TO SAY AND DO  THE GUILLOTINE IS NOT OF HIS INVENTION    THE DETAILS I JUST ENTERED ARE NOT COMPLETELY UNKNOWN EVERYWHERE  MR  PERCIVAL GORDON  WHO TOOK THE SENTENCE TO TRANSLATE JEAN SBOGAR IN ENGLISH  ON THE FIRST EDITION  DECLARES IN HIS PREFACE OF      THAT JEAN SBOGAR IS A CHARACTER HISTORICAL  WHOSE ADVENTUROUS FAME STILL FILLS THE STATES VENETIANS  AT LEAST IT WASN T IN ENGLAND THAT I WAS BLAMED THE SURREPTITIOUS IMITATION OF AN ENGLISH POEM WHICH DOES NOT LACK POPULARITY  AND THAT CONSOLES ME    I JUST HAVE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WILL DISTINGUISH THIS EDITION OF THE PREVIOUS ONES  AND IT S MORE THE BOOKSELLER S BUSINESS THAN MINE  THE CORRECTIONS WILL BE QUITE NUMEROUS  THEY WOULD BE COUNTLESS IF I HAD THE COURAGE DIFFICULT TO REREAD CAREFULLY WHAT I WROTE TWENTY YEARS AGO  WE WILL DESIGN WITHOUT HARDLY THERE ARE MANY MISTAKES TO BE LEFT IN A BOOK THAT IS NOT THE MASTER OF DESTROYING EVERYTHING IN ONE PIECE  THE SKY IS ME WITNESS THAT THIS IS THE ONLY ADVANTAGE THAT MAKES ME REGRET TODAY THE BAD LUCK OF MY FORTUNE  CARRIED AWAY IN A LARGER AND MORE MEMORABLE SHIPWRECK THAN MINE  PLECTUNTUR ACHIVI    THE TABLETS ARE INCREASED BY SEVERAL PAGES THAT MY FRIENDS HAD DELETED ON THE FIRST MANUSCRIPT  IN SOME ACCESS POLITICAL PRUDENCE THE MOTIVE OF WHICH ESCAPES ME COMPLETELY  FOR I FIND THEM NO MORE FOOLISH AND NO MORE FURIOUS THAN THE OTHER  WE KNOW WHAT I THINK OF THEM  AND WHY I GIVE THEM    WHAT WILL RESULT MOST ESSENTIAL OF THESE LONG AND BORING RANTINGS  IT IS THAT JEAN SBOGAR IS NEITHER OF ZCHOCKE  NOR OF BYRON  NEITHER OF BENJAMIN CONSTANT  NOR OF MME DE KRUDENER  THAT HE S IS FROM ME  AND THIS WAS VERY ESSENTIAL TO SAY FOR THE HONOR OF MME DE KRUDENER  BENJAMIN CONSTANT  BYRON AND ZCHOCKE    CHARLES NODIER      JEAN SBOGAR     I   ALAS  WHAT IS THIS LIFE WHERE NEVER FAILS AFFLICTIONS AND MISERIES  WHERE EVERYTHING IS FULL OF TRAPS AND ENEMIES  FOR THE CHALICE OF PAIN IS NOT RATHER EXHAUSTED LET IT FILL UP AGAIN  AND AN ENEMY IS NOT RATHER DEFEATED LET OTHERS COME FORWARD TO FIGHT IN HIS STEAD   IMITATION OF J  C    A LITTLE FURTHER THAN THE PORT OF TRIESTE  ADVANCING ON THE SEA   STRIKES  ON THE SIDE OF THE GREEN BAY OF PIRANO  WE FINDS A SMALL HERMITAGE  LONG ABANDONED  WHICH WAS FORMERLY UNDER THE INVOCATION OF SAINT ANDREW  AND WHO HAS KEPT THE NAME  THE SHORE  WHICH ALWAYS NARROWS TOWARDS THIS PLACE  WHERE IT SEEMS TO END BETWEEN THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN AND THE WAVES OF THE ADRIATIC  SEEMS TO GAIN IN BEAUTY AS IT LOSES IN EXTENT  AN ALMOST IMPENETRABLE GROVE OF FIG TREES AND WILD VINES  WHOSE FRESH GULF VAPORS MAINTAIN THE FOLIAGE IN A PERPETUAL STATE OF GREENERY AND YOUTH  SURROUNDS ON ALL SIDES THIS HOUSE OF MEDITATION AND MYSTERY  WHEN THE TWILIGHT HAS JUST PASSED  AND THE FACE OF THE SEA  SLIGHTLY RIPPLED BY THE SERENE BREATH OF THE NIGHT  BEGINS TO SWAY THE TREMBLING IMAGE OF THE STARS  IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPRESS ALL THAT THERE IS ENCHANTMENT IN THE SILENCE AND THE REST OF THIS SOLITUDE  YOU CAN HARDLY MAKE OUT BECAUSE OF ITS CONTINUITY WHICH MAKES IT LIKE AN ETERNAL SIGH  THE GENTLE SOUND OF WATERS DYING ON THE SAND  RARELY A TORCH WHICH CROSSES THE HORIZON WITH THE INVISIBLE BASKET OF THE FISHERMAN THROWS ON THE WAVES A FURROW OF LIGHT WHICH EXTENDS OR DIMINISHES ACCORDING TO THE AGITATION OF THE SEA  SHE SOON DISAPPEARS BEHIND A SANDBANK  AND EVERYTHING FALLS INTO DARKNESS  IN THIS BEAUTIFUL PLACE  THE SENSES  QUITE UNOCCUPIED  DO NOT DISTURB ANY DISTRACTION THE THOUGHTS OF THE SOUL  IT FREELY TAKES POSSESSION OF SPACE AND TIME  AS IF THEY HAD ALREADY CEASED TO TO ENCLOSE FOR IT WITHIN THE NARROW LIMITS OF LIFE  AND MAN  WHOSE HEART FULL OF STORMS OPENED ONLY TO TUMULTUOUS AND VIOLENT FEELINGS  SOMETIMES UNDERSTOOD THE HAPPINESS OF A DEEP CALM  THAT NOTHING THREATENS  THAT NOTHING ALTERS  BY STOPPING AT THE HERMITAGE OF SAINT ANDRE    NEAR THERE STOOD  IN       A CASTLE OF SIMPLE  BUT ELEGANT  WHICH HAS DISAPPEARED IN THE LAST WARS  THE LOCALS CALLED IT THE CASA MONTELEONE  FROM THE NON ITALIANATE OF A FRENCH EMIGRANT  WHO HAD RECENTLY DIED THERE  LEAVING A IMMENSE FORTUNE HE HAD ACQUIRED IN COMMERCE  HIS BOTH GIRLS STILL INHABITED

WHOSE EVEN CARESSES COULD NOT DISTRACT  WHAT REMAINED OF HIS HAPPINESS WAS ONLY HIM RECALL BITTERLY WHAT HE HAD LOST  THE SMILE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE REBORN ON HIS LIPS ONLY AT THE APPROACH OF DEATH  WHEN HE FELT THAT HIS HEART WAS GOING TO FREEZE  HIS FOREHEAD LADEN WITH TROUBLE CLEARED UP FOR A MOMENT  HE SEIZES THE HANDS OF HIS DAUGHTERS  BROUGHT TO HER LIPS  PRONOUNCED THE NAME OF LUCILE AND ANTONIA  AND HE EXPIRED    MME ALBERTI WAS THIRTY TWO YEARS OLD  SHE WAS A SENSITIVE WOMAN  BUT OF A SOFT AND A LITTLE SERIOUS SENSITIVITY  WHICH WAS NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO SPLINTERS AND TRANSPORT  SHE HAD A LOT SUFFERED  AND NONE OF THE PAINFUL IMPRESSIONS OF HIS LIFE WERE ENTIRELY EFFACED FROM HIS SOUL  BUT SHE KEPT HER MEMORIES  WITHOUT NOURISHING THEM ON PURPOSE  IT WAS NOT DONE AN OCCUPATION OF HER PAIN  AND SHE DID NOT PUSH BACK FEELINGS WHICH LINK BY SOME LINKS THOSE WHOSE LINKS THE MOST EXPENSIVE HAVE BEEN BROKEN  SHE DID NOT TAKE COURAGE RESIGNATION  SHE HAD THE INSTINCT  AN IMAGINATION MOREOVER VERY MOBILE  AND EASY TO GET LOST IN A CROWD OF VARIOUS OBJECTS  MADE IT MORE SUITABLE FOR RECEIVING DISTRACTIONS  AND EVEN LOOKING FOR THEM  LONG ONLY DAUGHTER AND SOLE OBJECT OF THE CARE OF HER FAMILY  SHE HAD HAD AN EDUCATION BRILLIANT  BUT THE HABIT OF GIVING IN TO EVENTS WITHOUT RESISTANCE  MOST OFTEN MAKING THE USE OF ITS JUDGMENT  HIS WAY OF APPRECIATING THINGS WAS LESS REASONING THAN IMAGINATION  NO ONE WAS LESS ELATED  AND YET NO ONE WAS MORE ROMANTIC  BUT IT WAS FAILURE TO KNOW THE WORLD  FINALLY  THE PAST HAD BEEN SO HARSH FOR HER  THAT SHE COULD NO LONGER ASPIRE TO A VERY HAPPY STATE  BUT HER ORGANIZATION ALSO DEFENDED HER FROM ABSOLUTE MISFORTUNE  WHEN SHE LOST HER FATHER  SHE LOOKED AT ANTONIA AS HER GIRL  SHE HAD NO CHILDREN  AND ANTONIA HAD JUST REACHED IN ITS SEVENTEENTH YEAR  MADAME ALBERTI PROMISED TO TAKE CARE OF HER HAPPINESS  IT WAS HIS FIRST THOUGHT  AND THIS THOUGHT SOFTENS THE BITTERNESS OF OTHERS  MADAME ALBERTI COULD NEVER HAVE UNDERSTAND THE LOATHING OF LIFE  AS LONG AS SHE FELT THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING USEFUL AND STILL BEING LOVED    ANTONIA S MOTHER HAD SUCCUMBED TO A BREAST DISEASE  ANTONIA DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE THIS CONDITION  OFTEN HEREDITARY  BUT SHE SEEMED NOT TO HAVE DRAWN  FROM A BREAST ALREADY INHABITED BY DEATH  THAN A FRAGILE AND IMPERFECT EXISTENCE  SHE WAS TALL HOWEVER  AND AS DEVELOPED AS WE ARE USUALLY AT HIS AGE  ONLY THERE WAS IN HIS HEIGHT SLENDER AND SLENDER AN ABANDONMENT WHICH ANNOUNCED WEAKNESS  HER HEAD  WITH A GRACEFUL AND CHARMING EXPRESSION  A LITTLE LEANING ON HIS SHOULDER  HER HAIR  A LIGHT BLOND  TIED WITH NEGLIGENCE  HER DAZZLING WHITE COMPLEXION  BARELY ANIMATED A SLIGHT SHADE OF THE SOFTEST CRIMSON  HIS LOOK A LITTLE VEILED  WHICH A NATURAL ORGAN DEFECT MADE SHY AND ANXIOUS  AND WHO BECAME SADLY VAGUE LOOKING FOR THE OBJECTS DISTANT  EVERYTHING ABOUT HER GAVE THE IDEA OF   A HABITUAL STATE OF LANGUOR AND SUFFERING  SHE WAS NOT IN PAIN  SHE LIVED IMPERFECTLY AND AS IF WITH A KIND OF EFFORT  ACCUSTOMED FROM CHILDHOOD WITH THE STRONGEST EMOTIONS  THIS PAINFUL LEARNING HAD NOT BLUNTED HIS SENSITIVITY  AND HAD NOT MADE IT LESS ACCESSIBLE TO LESS DEEP EMOTIONS  SHE SUFFERED THEM ALL  ON THE CONTRARY  WITH THE SAME FORCE  IT SEEMED THAT HIS HEART HAD ONLY ONE WAY OF FEELING  BECAUSE HE STILL ONLY HAD ONE FEELING  AND THAT EVERYTHING HE FELT REMINDED HIM OF THE SAME PAINS  LOSS OF MOTHER AND FATHER  ALSO THE LEAST CIRCUMSTANCE AWAKENED IN HER THAT FATAL FACULTY OF ASSOCIATE WITH THE SORROWS OF OTHERS  ANYTHING THAT COULD ALLOW HIS IMAGINATION THIS CONNECTION OF IDEAS DREW TEARS FROM HIM OR STRUCK HER WITH A SUDDEN SHUDDER  THIS TREMOR WAS SO FREQUENT  THAT DOCTORS HAD REGARDED IT AS A DISEASE  ANTONIA  WHO KNEW HE WAS CEASING TO BE WITH HIS CAUSE  DID DID NOT SHARE THEIR CONCERN  BUT SHE HAD CONCLUDED  OF GOOD HOUR  OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE AND OF SOME OTHERS  THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT HIS ORGANIZATION  OF CONSEQUENCES IN CONSEQUENCES SHE CAME TO THINK THAT SHE WAS  UP TO A POINT  DISGRACED FROM NATURE  THIS PERSUASION INCREASED HIS SHYNESS AND ESPECIALLY HIS PENCHANT FOR LONELINESS  TO THE POINT OF ALARMING MADAME ALBERTI  WHO WAS EASILY  LIKE ALL THOSE WHO LOVE    THEIR USUAL PROMENADE WAS ON THE SHORES OF THE GULF  UNTIL FIRST PALACES WHICH ANNOUNCE THE ENTRY OF TRIESTE  FROM THERE THE EYES EXTEND OVER THE SEA  AND FROM DISTANCE TO DISTANCE  A FEW MORE OR LESS CLOSE POINTS THAT ESCAPED SIGHT ANTONIA  BUT THAT MADAME ALBERTI HAD RETURNED SO PRESENT BY DINT OF DESCRIBING THEM TO HIM  THERE WAS NO DAYS THAT SHE DID NOT ENTERTAIN HIM WITH THE GREAT MEMORIES THAT POPULATE THIS POETIC COUNTRY  OF THE ARGONAUTS WHO HAD VISITED IT  JAPIX WHICH HAD GIVEN ITS NAME TO ITS INHABITANTS  FROM DIOMEDES AND OF ANTENOR WHO HAD GIVEN THEM LAWS     WHILE CIRCLING THE HORIZON  AND AFTER HAVING TRAVERSED THIS DISTANT LINE OF A DARK BLUE  WHICH STANDS OUT FROM THE AZURE MORE CLEAR FROM THE SKY  CAN YOU DISTINGUISH    SHE SAID TO HIM    A TOWER WHOSE TOP REFLECTS THE SUN S RAYS  IT IS THAT OF THE POWERFUL AGUILEE  ONE OF THE ANCIENT QUEENS OF THE WORLD  THERE S SOME LEFT BARELY A FEW RUINS  NOT FAR FROM THERE FLOWS A RIVER THAT MY FATHER SHOWED ME IN MY CHILDHOOD  THE TIMAVE  WHICH WAS SUNG BY VIRGIL  THIS MOUNTAIN RANGE  WHICH CROWNS TRIESTE  RISES ALMOST SHEER ABOVE ITS WALLS  AND GROWS AT OUR RIGHT  FROM THE HAMLET OF OPSCHINA  OVER AN INCALCULABLE EXPANSE  SERVES AS A HAVEN FOR A HOST OF FAMOUS PEOPLES IN HISTORY OR INTERESTING BY THEIR MANNERS  THERE LIVE THESE BRAVE TYROLEANS WHOSE YOU HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THE RUSTIC GENIUS  COURAGE AND LOYALTY  HERE  THESE AMIABLE PEASANTS OF FRIULI  WHOSE PASTORAL DANCES AND HAPPY SONGS HAVE BECOME EUROPEAN  COMING BACK TO US  YOU MUST NOTICE A LITTLE HIGHER THAN THE LAST MASTS OF THE PORT  ABOVE THE ROOFS OF LAZARETTO  PART OF THE MOUNTAIN  WHO IS INFINITELY MORE OBSCURE THAN THE OTHERS  WHO DOMINATES THEM MANY  AND WHOSE GIGANTIC AND DARK ASPECT INSPIRES THE RESPECT AND TERROR  IT IS THE CAPE OF DUINO  THE CASTLE WHICH OCCUPIES THE FACT  AND WHOSE BATTLEMENTS I SEE FROM HERE  PASSES FOR TO HAVE BEEN BUILT DURING A FORMER INVASION OF BARBARIANS   THE PEOPLE STILL CALL IT THE PALACE OF ATTILA  DURING THE CIVIL WARS IN ITALY  DANTE  OUTLAWED FROM FLORENCE  SOUGHT AN ASYLUM  IT IS CLAIMED THAT THIS SINISTER STAY INSPIRED HIM TO PLAN HIS POEM  AND THAT IT IS THERE THAT HE UNDERTOOK TO PAINT HELL  SINCE THEN  IT HAS BEEN INHABITED IN TURN BY PARTY LEADERS AND BY THIEVES  IN THIS CENTURY WHERE EVERYTHING IS FADING  I FEAR IT FELL IN SHARE WITH SOME PEACEFUL LORD  WHO WILL HAVE DEPOPULATED FROM DEMONS ITS FORMIDABLE TOWERS TO NEST DOVES      THIS WAS MOST OFTEN THE SUBJECT OF MADAME ALBERTI WITH HER SISTER  TO WHOM SHE SOUGHT TO INSPIRE LITTLE BY LITTLE DESIRE TO SEE NEW OBJECTS  IN THE HOPE OF PRODUCING A FAVORABLE DIVERSION FROM HIS USUAL IDEAS  BUT THE ANTONIA S CHARACTER DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH TENACITY TO FOLLOW LONG THE IMPULSE OF A CURIOUS DESIRE  SHE WAS TOO WEAK AND DISTRUSTED HERSELF TOO MUCH TO DARE TO CONCEIVE OF A WILL OUT OF HIS CONDITION  AND  AS HIS DEPRESSION SEEMED NATURAL TO HIM  SHE DIDN T THINK OF GETTING OUT  IT NEEDED SOMETHING OTHER THAN SIMPLE MOTIVE OF CURIOSITY TO DETERMINE IT  THE TOMB OF HIS PARENTS WAS ALL SHE KNEW IN THE WORLD  AND SHE DIDN T NOT SUPPOSE THERE WAS ANYTHING TO LOOK BEYOND     BUT BRITTANY    SAID MADAME ALBERTI TO HER    BRITTANY IS YOUR HOMELAND      THAT S NOT WHERE THEY DIED    REPLIED ANTONIA  EMBRACING IT    AND THEIR MEMORY DOES NOT DWELL THERE        II   THEY ARE FORMIDABLE MEN WHOSE DESIRE TO SEE BLOOD HOLDS AWAKE DURING THE LONGEST WINTER NIGHTS  AND WHO WOULD SLAUGHTER A YOUNG BRIDE TO HAVE HER PEARL NECKLACE   CONDOLA    ISTRIA  SUCCESSIVELY OCCUPIED AND ABANDONED BY ARMIES OF DIFFERENT NATIONS  ENJOYED ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS OF FREEDOM STORMY THAT A WEAK PEOPLE TASTES BETWEEN TWO CONQUESTS  LAWS HAD NOT YET REGAINED THEIR STRENGTH  AND JUSTICE SUSPENDED SEEMED TO RESPECT EVEN CRIMES THAT A REVOLUTION COULD MAKE HAPPY  IN THE GREAT POLITICAL ANXIETIES  THERE IS A SORT OF SECURITY ATTACHED TO THE BANNER OF THE SCOUNDRELS  SHE CAN BECOME THAT OF THE STATE AND THE WORLD  AND THE VERY MEN WHO BELIEVE VIRTUOUS RESPECT IT OUT OF PRUDENCE  THE MULTIPLICITY OF IRREGULAR TROOPS  RAISED IN THE NAME OF NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE AND ALMOST UNBEKNOWNST TO THE KINGS  HAD FAMILIARIZED THE CITIZENS WITH THESE ARMED BANDS WHICH DESCENDED FROM THE MOUNTAINS AT ALL TIMES  AND WHICH FROM THERE SPREAD TO ALL THE EDGES OF THE GULF  ALMOST ALL WERE ANIMATED BY THE MOST GENEROUS FEELINGS  LED BY THE THE PUREST DEVOTION  BUT BEHIND THEM WAS FORMED WASTE OF THOSE VIOLENT MEN  FOR WHOM THE DISORDERS OF POLITICS ARE ONLY A PRETEXT  A FORMIDABLE LEAGUE TO ALL GOVERNMENTS AND DISOWNED BY ALL  A DETERMINED ENEMY OF SOCIAL FORCES  SHE OPENLY AIMED AT THE DESTRUCTION OF ALL INSTITUTIONS ESTABLISHED  SHE PROCLAIMED FREEDOM AND HAPPINESS  BUT SHE MARCHED ACCOMPANIED BY ARSON  LOOTING AND ASSASSINATION  TEN SMOLDERING VILLAGES ALREADY BORE WITNESS TO THE HORRIFIC PROGRESS OF BROTHERS OF THE COMMON GOOD  THIS IS HOW IT WAS ORIGINALLY CALLED  BEFORE PUTTING ONESELF ABOVE ALL THE CONVENIENCES AND VIOLATE ALL LAWS  THE BLOODTHIRSTY TROOP OF JEAN SBOGAR    THE BRIGANDS HAD APPEARED AT SANTA CROCE  AT OPSCHINA  AT MATERIA  WE ASSURED THAT THEY EVEN OCCUPIED DUINO CASTLE  AND THAT IT WAS FROM THE FOOT OF THIS PROMONTORY THAT THEY THREW THEMSELVES  OF THE NIGHT  LIKE HUNGRY WOLVES  ON ALL THE SHORES OF GULF  WHERE THEY CARRIED DESOLATION AND TERROR  THE PEOPLES TERRIFIED SOON RUSHED TO TRIESTE  THE CASA MONTELEONE IN PARTICULAR WAS FAR FROM A SAFE HAVEN  A NOISE HAD SPREAD THAT JEAN SBOGAR HIMSELF HAD BEEN SEEN WANDERING  IN THE MIDST OF DARKNESS  UNDER THE CASTLE WALLS  FAME GAVE IT COLOSSAL AND TERRIBLE FORMS  IT WAS CLAIMED THAT FRIGHTENED BATTALIONS HAD RETREATED AT HIS SIGHT ALONE  TOO WAS HE NOT A SIMPLE PEASANT FROM ISTRIA OR CROATIA  LIKE THE MOST OF THE ADVENTURERS WHO ACCOMPANIED HIM  THE VULGAR THE WAS THE GRANDSON OF THE FAMOUS BRIGAND SOCIVISKA  AND THE PEOPLE OF WORLD SAID HE WAS DESCENDED FROM SCANDERBERG  THE PYRRHUS OF MODERN ILLYRIANS  SIMPLE MEN  WHO ARE STILL IN LOVE OF WONDERS  ADORNED ITS HISTORY WITH THE MOST SINGULAR AND THE MOST DIVERSE  BUT WE AGREED TO ADMIT THAT HE WAS FEARLESS AND RUTHLESS  IN NO TIME HIS NAME HAD ACQUIRED THE CREDIT OF A TRADITION OF ANCIENT TIMES  AND IN THE FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE OF THIS PEOPLE  AMONG WHOM ALL THE IDEAS OF GREATNESS AND POWER COME TOGETHER IN THAT OF AN ADVANCED AGE  WE CALLED HIM OLD SBOGAR  ALTHOUGH NO ONE KNEW WHAT NUMBER YEARS HAD PASSED OVER HIS HEAD  AND NONE OF HIS COMPANIONS  FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF JUSTICE  COULD NOT HAVE GIVEN LESS INFORMATION    MADAME ALBERTI  WHOM AN EASY TO SHAKE IMAGINATION DISPOSED TO WELCOME EXTRAORDINARY IDEAS  AND WHO TOOK CARE OF JEAN SBOGAR SINCE THE MOMENT THE NAME OF THIS MAN STRUCK HIS EARS FOR THE FIRST TIME  IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE FELT THE NEED TO LEAVE CASA MONTELEONE FOR TRIESTE  BUT SHE HID HER MOTIVES FROM ANTONIA  WHOSE SENSITIVITY SHE FEARED  SHE HAD ALSO HEARD OF THE BROTHERS OF THE COMMON GOOD AND OF THEIR CAPTAIN  SHE HAD CRIED OVER CRIMES THEY WERE WERE GUILTY WHEN THE STORY REACHED HIM  BUT THIS IMPRESSION LEFT LITTLE TRACE IN HIS MIND  BECAUSE THAT SHE MISUNDERSTOOD THE WICKED   IT SEEMED THAT SHE AVOIDED THINKING OF THEM  SO AS NOT TO BE FORCED TO HATE THEM  THIS FEELING WAS BEYOND THE MEASURE OF HIS STRENGTH    THERE IS SOMETHING MELANCHOLY ABOUT THE POSITION OF TRIESTE WHICH WOULD SQUEEZE THE HEART  IF THE IMAGINATION WAS NOT DISTRACTED BY THE MAGNIFICENCE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS  BY THE WEALTH OF MORE CHEERFUL CULTURES  IT WAS THE BACK OF A BARREN ROCK  EMBRACED BY THE SEA  BUT THE EFFORTS OF MAN GAVE BIRTH TO IT NATURE S MOST PRECIOUS GIFTS  PRESSED BETWEEN THE SEA IMMENSE AND INACCESSIBLE HEIGHTS  IT OFFERED THE IMAGE OF A JAIL  ART  CONQUERING THE GROUND  MADE IT A DELIGHTFUL STAY  ITS BUILDINGS  WHICH EXTEND AMPHITHEATRICALLY FROM THE PORT UP TO A THIRD OF THE ELEVATION OF THE MOUNTAIN  AND BEYOND WHICH GROWS  FROM DEGREE TO DEGREE  ORCHARDS OF A GRACE INEXPRESSIBLE  PRETTY CHESTNUT WOODS  BUSHES OF FIG TREES  POMEGRANATE TREES  MYRTLES  JASMINES  WHICH SCENT THE AIR  AND ABOVE ALL THIS THE AUSTERE PEAK OF THE ALPS ILLYRIAN  REMIND TRAVELERS CROSSING THE GULF THE INGENIOUS INVENTION OF THE CORINTHIAN CAPITAL  IT IS A BASKET OF BOUQUETS  FRESH AS SPRING  WHICH RESTS UNDER A ROCK  IN THIS LOVELY SOLITUDE  BUT LIMITED  WE HAVE NOTHING NEGLECTED TO MULTIPLY THE PLEASANT SENSATIONS  NATURE HAS GAVE IN TRIESTE A SMALL FOREST OF HOLM OAKS  WHICH BECAME A PLACE OF DELIGHT  IT IS CALLED  IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE COUNTRY  THE FARNEDO  OR THE GROVE  NEVER THESE RURAL DIVINITIES  WHOSE HAPPY SHORES OF THE ADRIATIC ARE THE FAVORITE LAND  LAVISHED  IN A SPACE OF LITTLE EXTENT  MORE BEAUTIES MADE TO SEDUCE  LE BOSQUET OFTEN EVEN ADDS TO ALL ITS CHARMS THAT OF LONELINESS  BECAUSE THE INHABITANT OF TRIESTE  OCCUPIED DISTANT SPECULATIONS  NEEDS A BROAD POINT OF VIEW AND INDEFINITE LIKE HOPE  STANDING ON THE END OF A CAPE  AND HIS TELESCOPE FIXED ON THE HORIZON  HIS PLEASURE IS TO LOOK FOR A SAIL DISTANT  AND FROM THE FARNEDO ONE CANNOT SEE THE SEA  ALBERTI OFTEN DROVE HIS ANTONIA THERE  BECAUSE ONLY THERE SHE FOUND THE PICTURE OF A WORLD FOREIGN TO THAT WHERE HER PUPIL HAD LIVED UNTIL THEN  AND ABLE TO EXCITE IN HIS YOUNG IMAGINATION THE DESIRE FOR NEW SENSATIONS  FOR A LIVING SOUL  THE FARNEDO IS A THOUSAND LEAGUES FROM THE TOWNS  AND MRS  ALBERTI SOUGHT TO DEVELOP IN ANTONIA THAT INSTINCT FOR IMMENSITY WHICH WEAKENS LOCAL IMPRESSIONS  AND THAT MAKES THEM LESS DURABLE AND LESS DANGEROUS  SHE ALREADY HAD ENOUGH LIFE EXPERIENCE TO KNOW THAT TO BE HAPPY IS ONLY TO HAVE FUN    THE FEAST OF THE OAK GROVE HAD THE MOST CHARM SPICY FOR MADAME ALBERTI  RAISED LIKE A MAN WE WANT MAKE AN EDUCATED MAN  SHE KNEW THE POETS  AND HAD OFTEN DREAMED OF THOSE DANCES OF ARCADIA AND SICILY  WHICH HAVE SO OF AMENITIES IN THEIR VERSES  SHE REMEMBERED THEM  IN COSTUME NEAR  SEEING THE ISTRIAN SHEPHERD IN HIS FLOATING HABIT AND LIGHT  LOADED WITH BOWS AND RIBBONS  UNDER HIS LARGE HAT CROWNED WITH BOUQUETS OF FLOWERS  LIFT CASUALLY AND PUT BACK ON THE GRASS THE YOUNG GIRL WHO ESCAPES HIM  HER HEAD VEILED  WITHOUT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED  AND WHO GETS LOST  IN ANOTHER GROUP  AT THE AMONG HER COMPANIONS  SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER  OFTEN A VOICE SUDDENLY RISES AMONG THE DANCERS  THAT OF AN ADVENTURER OF APENNINES  WHO SINGS SOME STANZAS FROM ARIOSTO OR TASSO  IT IS THE DEATH OF ISABELLE OR THAT OF SOPHRONIE  AND AT THIS NATION WHICH ENJOYS ALL ITS EMOTIONS  AND WHICH IS PROUD OF ALL HIS MISTAKES  THE ILLUSIONS OF A POET ARE AUTHORITIES THAT ASK FOR TEARS  ONE DAY  AS ANTONIA WALKED IN NEXT DOOR OF HER SISTER IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE OF THESE GATHERINGS  SHE WAS STOPPED BY THE SOUND OF AN INSTRUMENT SHE DID NOT KNOW  SHE APPROACHED AND SAW AN OLD MAN WHO WALKED REGULARLY ON A KIND OF GUITAR  TOPPED WITH A SINGLE STRING OF HORSEHAIR  A BOW COARSE  AND WHICH SOUNDED HOARSE AND MONOTONOUS  BUT VERY GOES WELL WITH HIS DEEP  RHYTHMIC VOICE  HE SANG  IN VERSE SLAVES  THE MISFORTUNE OF THE POOR DALMATIANS  WHOM MISERY EXILED OF THEIR COUNTRY  HE IMPROVISED COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE ABANDONMENT OF THE NATIVE LAND  ON THE BEAUTIES OF THE GENTLE COUNTRYSIDE OF THE HAPPY MACARSCA  FROM ANCIENT TRAO  FROM CURZOLE WITH BLACK SHADES  OF CHERSO AND D OSSERO  WHERE MEDEA DISPERSED THE TORN LIMBS OF ABSYRTHE  OF BEAUTIFUL EPIDAURUS  ALL COVERED WITH LAURELS ROSES  AND SALONE  WHOM DIOCLETIAN PREFERRED TO THE EMPIRE OF THE WORLD  AT HIS VOICE  THE SPECTATORS FIRST MOVED  THEN MOVED AND TRANSPORTED  CROWDED TOGETHER SOBBING  BECAUSE IN THE ORGANIZATION TENDER AND MOBILE OF THE ISTRIAN  ALL SYMPATHIES BECOME PERSONAL EMOTIONS  AND ALL FEELINGS OF PASSIONS  SOME SHOUTED SHRILLY  OTHERS PULLED BACK AGAINST THEM THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN  THERE WERE SOME WHO KISSED SAND AND CRUSHING IT BETWEEN THEIR TEETH  AS IF WE HAD WANTED TO TEAR THEM ALSO FROM THEIR HOMELAND  ANTONIA SURPRISE WALKED SLOWLY TOWARDS THE OLD MAN  AND LOOKING AT HIM MORE CLOSE  SHE NOTICED THAT HE WAS BLIND LIKE HOMER  SHE REACHED FOR HIS HAND TO DEPOSIT A PIERCED SILVER COIN  BECAUSE THAT SHE KNEW THAT THIS GIFT WAS PRECIOUS TO POOR MORLAQUES  WHICH ADORN THE HAIR OF THEIR DAUGHTERS  THE OLD POET GRABBED BY THE ARM AND SMILED  BECAUSE HE SAW THAT IT WAS A YOUNG WOMAN  SO  INSTANTLY CHANGING FASHION AND SUBJECT  HE BEGAN TO CELEBRATE THE SWEETS OF LOVE AND THE GRACES OF THE YOUTH  IT WAS NO LONGER ACCOMPANIED BY THE GUZLA  BUT IT ACCENTUATED HIS LINES WITH MUCH MORE VEHEMENCE  AND ALL HE HAD STRENGTH  LIKE A MAN WHOSE REASON IS DISTURBED BY DRUNKENNESS OR BY A VIOLENT PASSION  HE HIT THE GROUND WITH HIS FEET  BRINGING ANTONIA BACK TO HIM  ALMOST TERRIFIED     FLOWERED  FLOWERED    HE CRIED    IN THE FRAGRANT GROVES OF PIRANO  AND AMONG THE GRAPES OF TRIESTE THAT SMELL OF ROSES  THE JASMINE ITSELF  WHICH IS THE ORNAMENT OF OUR BUSHES  PERISHES AND DELIVERS ITS LITTLE FLOWER TO THE AIR  BEFORE IT HAS OPENED  IN THE POISONED PLAINS OF NARENTE  THIS IS HOW YOU WOULD DRY UP IF YOU GREW  YOUNG PLANT  IN THE FORESTS WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO THE DOMINATION OF JEAN SBOGAR        III   THE HILLS HEAR THE SOUND OF THAT TERRIBLE VOICE  THEIR BLACKS ROCKS AND THEIR GROVES QUIVER  WARNED BY THE DREAMS OF DANGER  THE PEOPLE RUN THROUGH THE HEATHER AND LIGHT THE ALARM SIGNALS   OSSIAN    ANTONIA SLOWLY RETURNED TO THE CITY  LEANING ON HER SISTER  BUT SILENT AND THOUGHTFUL  THE NAME OF THE BRIGAND WAS NOT BORN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS HEART A FEELING OF FEAR FOR HERSELF AND A VAGUE WORRY ABOUT HER FUTURE  SHE HAD THOUGHT TO THE FATE OF THE UNFORTUNATE WHO FELL INTO HIS HANDS  WITHOUT ASSUMING NEVER COULD THIS DESTINY BECOME HIS  AND THE LANGUAGE AS INSPIRED BY THE OLD MORLAQUE IMPROVISER HAD STRUCK HER WITH TERROR  BY MAKING HIM UNDERSTAND THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS TERRIBLE MISFORTUNE  AMONG THE VARIOUS ACCIDENTS OF WHICH LIFE IS THREATENED  THIS IDEA WAS HOWEVER SO DEVOID OF REASON  THIS DANGER SO FAR FROM ALL LIKELIHOOD THAT ANTONIA  WHO HAD NO SECRETS FOR MADAME ALBERTI  DID NOT DARE TO CONFIDE IN HER THE SUBJECT OF TROUBLE  SHE MOVED CLOSER TO HER  PRESSED HERSELF AGAINST HER WITH A THRILL AS THE PROGRESS OF THE NIGHT  THE SILENCE OF LONELINESS  THE STILL MORE FRIGHTENING MURMUR THAT CAME FROM TIME TO TIME DEEP IN THE WOODS  ONLY INCREASED  UNNECESSARILY MADAM ALBERTI TRIED TO TAKE HIS MIND OFF THE FEELING THAT SEEMED TO FILL IT  AS SHE IGNORED WHAT COULD EXCITE HIM  CHANCE MADE HIM CHOOSE THE REASON FOR THE CONVERSATION CLEANER TO MAINTAIN IT     WHAT A DISASTROUS FAME THAT OF JEAN SBOGAR    SHE SAYS    HOW PAINFUL IT IS TO FIX MEN S ATTENTION TO THIS PRICE      AND WHO KNOWS    REPLIED ANTONIA    IF IT IS NOT THE FOOLISH DESIRE TO FIX THEIR ATTENTION  WHICH HAS PRODUCED SO MUCH DISTRACTIONS AND SO MANY CRIMES  BESIDES    SHE ADDED  IN THE SECRET INTENTION PERHAPS TO REASSURE HERSELF    THERE IS UNDOUBTEDLY A LOT OF EXAGGERATION IN WHAT ONE TELLS ABOUT IT  I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE SLANDERING A LITTLE THESE PEOPLE THAT WE CALL VILLAINS  AND THE IDEA THAT I HAVE OF THE GOODNESS OF GOD DOES NOT RECONCILE WELL WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF DEPRAVITY IF HORRIBLE      THE BENEVOLENCE OF YOUR HEART DECEIVES YOU    REPLIED MADAME ALBERTI    IT IS TRUE THAT ABSOLUTE EVIL IS REPUGNANT TO THE JUST IDEA THAT WE WE MAKE OUT OF THE EXTREME GOODNESS OF THE CREATOR AND THE PERFECTION OF HIS WORKS  BUT HE CERTAINLY BELIEVED IT NECESSARY FOR THEIR HARMONY  SINCE IT HAS PLACED IT IN EVERYTHING THAT HAS COME OUT OF ITS HANDS BESIDE THE GOOD AND THE BEAUTIFUL  WHY WOULDN T HE HAVE THROWN IN THE SOCIETY OF DEVOURING AND TERRIBLE SOULS  WHO ONLY CONCEIVE THOUGHTS OF DEATH  AS HE UNLEASHED IN THE DESERTS THESE TIGERS AND THOSE DREADFUL PANTHERS  WHO DRINK THE BLOOD OF ANIMALS WITHOUT EVER QUENCHING THEIR THIRST  ALTHOUGH IT WAS THE PRINCIPLE OF ALL GOOD  HE WANTED TO ALLOW EVIL IN THE MORAL ORDER  BUT HAS HE NOT GIVEN UGLY FORMS TO CERTAIN SPECIES IN THE PHYSICAL ORDER  ALTHOUGH IT IS THE PRINCIPLE OF ALL BEAUTY  AND THAT HE HAS CLOTHED HIS WORKS WITH SO MANY ATTRACTIONS WHEN HE HAS DESIRED  DIDN T YOU NOTICE THAT HE LIKED TO TIE THE SEAL REPELLING EVIL BEINGS WITH THE MOST OFF PUTTING UGLINESS AND DANGEROUS  DO YOU REMEMBER THAT KIND OF WHITE VULTURE LIKE SNOW  THAT ONE OF MY FATHER S CORRESPONDENTS HAD BROUGHT FROM MALTA  ITS SHAPE IS NOT UNPLEASANT  THERE IS NOTHING MORE PURE AND MORE ELEGANT THAN ITS PLUMAGE  WHEN WE SEE IT BY THE BACK ON ONE OF THE SCATTERED STONES OF THE CEMETERIES WHERE HE MADE HIS REMAINS  DO YOU WANT TO APPROACH IT AND EXAMINE IT IN DETAIL  IF HE TURNS AROUND  HOPPING ON HIS SLENDER LEGS  AND HE STOP ON YOU HIS EYE FULL OF BLOODY FIRE SURROUNDED BY A BROAD CADAVEROUS FILM  LIKE A SPECTER MASK  YOU SHUDDER WITH HORROR AND DISGUST  UNDER THE MOST APPEARANCES FLATTERING  I CONVINCE MYSELF THAT IT IS THE SAME FOR ALL WICKED  AND THAT WE FIND IN THEM  AT FIRST GLANCE  THE SIGN DISTINCT FROM THE REPROBATION THAT GOD ATTACHED TO THEM BY CREATING THEM FOR THE CRIME      ACCORDING TO THAT    SAID ANTONIA  AFFECTING TO SMILE    YOUR IMAGINATION DOES NOT LEND VERY SEDUCTIVE CHARMS TO THE CHIEF OF BROTHERS OF THE COMMON GOOD  YOU MUST HAVE A STRANGE IDEA OF   THE BEAUTY OF JEAN SBOGAR      MADAME ALBERTI  WHO PRESENTED HERSELF WITH EXTREME EASE OBJECTS WITH WHICH HIS MIND WAS STRUCK  AND WHICH HAD BEEN COMPOSED IMMEDIATELY THE IDEAL OF THE MOST FEROCIOUS OF BANDITS  WOULD RESPOND TO HIS SISTER  WHEN THE SOUND OF A HURRIED FOOTSTEP WAS HEARD BEHIND THEM  AT THE BEND OF THE PATH    NIGHT HAD FALLEN COMPLETELY  AND ALL THE WALKERS WERE RETURNED TO THE BASTIDES  WHOSE AMPHITHEATER IS STREWN WITH SPACE IN SPACE  THE TWO SISTERS STOPPED SHAKING  PAINFULLY WARNED BY THE DARK IMAGES THAT HAD JUST PASSED IN FRONT OF THEIR EYES  THEY WERE LISTENING  STILL AND BREATHING SUSPENDED  A SOFT  MELODIOUS VOICE  ONE OF THOSE VOICES THAT HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF ENCHANTING CARES  OF TRANSPORTING THE SOUL IN A CALMER REGION  IN A MORE PERFECT LIFE  SUCCEEDED TO THEIR DISTURBS A PLEASANT EMOTION    HE WAS A YOUNG MAN  ONE COULD JUDGE BY THE DELICACY AND THE FRESHNESS OF HIS ORGAN  HE WAS WRAPPED IN A MAN  HOLD SHORT IN THE VENETIAN STYLE  WEARING A HAT TURNED UP WITH PLUMES FLOATING  AND IT PASSED OVER THE PATH  OR RATHER IT FLEW FROM ROCK TO ROCK  LIKE A NIGHT GHOST  REPEATING THE REFRAIN OF THE OLD BLIND MAN     IF EVER YOU GREW  YOUNG PLANT  IN FORESTS SUBJECT TO THE DOMINATION OF JEAN SBOGAR  OF THE CRUEL JEAN SBOGAR      REACHED A HIGHER ROCK  ITS WHITENESS DETACHED FROM THE OUTLINE DARK OF THE MOUNTAIN  HE REMAINED STANDING AND ABRUPTLY INTERRUPTED HIS REFRAIN  THEN  AFTER A MOMENT OF SILENCE  HE LEFT THE PLACE WHERE IT HAD STOPPED SUCH A SAVAGE  SO PAINFUL CRY  SO FORMIDABLE AND SO PLAINTIVE AT THE SAME TIME  THAT IT DID NOT SEEM PROCEED WITH A HUMAN VOICE  AND AT THE SAME TIME  THIS MOAN FIERCE  LIKE THAT OF A HYENA WHO HAS LOST HER YOUNG  REPEATED ON TWENTY DIFFERENT POINTS OF THE FOREST  THEN THE UNKNOWN DISAPPEARED  RESUMING HIS ROMANCE    ANTONIA WAS NOT FULLY REASSURED UNTIL ENTERING THE CITY  AND SHE HAD OFTEN PROMISED HERSELF  ON RETURNING  NOT TO LEAVE IF LATE THE FARNEDO  LOOKING BACK ON IT  HOWEVER  SHE CONDEMNED HER TERRORS  AND FOUND  IN ALL THAT HAD MOVED HER  NATURAL EXPLANATIONS  BUT HIS WEAKNESS AND SHYNESS DO NOT SOON WON OUT OVER THE EFFORTS OF HIS REASON  HER SENSITIVITY  IN THE ABSENCE OF EXTERNAL EXERCISE  BECAME MORE AND MORE MORE TO SCARY CHIMERAS   IT WAS LOST IN A BOUNDLESS WAVE  AND IT WAS COMPOSED IN SHE HAS A WORRIED FEELING ABOUT THE WORLD  THAT HER ISOLATION  HER DISTRUST  ITS ESTRANGEMENT FROM ALL THE MANY SOCIETIES MADE HIM MORE IRRITABLE DAY BY DAY  SOMETIMES THIS MESS IDEAS  PRODUCED BY FEAR  WENT TO A SORT OF BEWILDERMENT WHICH CAUSED HIM SHAME AND DREAD  MADAME ALBERTI HAD IT NOTICED WITH EXTREME PAIN  BUT  FAITHFUL TO HIS SYSTEM OF DISTRACTION  SHE ALWAYS PROMISED HERSELF TO PROVIDE ENOUGH DIVERSION TO HIS MIND  UNTIL HAPPY AFFECTION AND LEGITIMATE CAME TO GIVE IT TO HIS HEART  IT WAS THE LAST  IT WAS ALSO THE MOST PLEASANT AND THE MOST SPECIOUS OF HIS HOPES  HE DO NOT DESPAIR OF ANYTHING FOR THOSE WHO DID NOT LIKE  THEIR EXISTENCE HAS A COMPLEMENT TO RECEIVE  AND A COMPLEMENT WHICH IS OFTEN THE DESTINY OF ALL THE REST OF LIFE      IV   THEN APPEAR STRANGE  UNFORESEEN AND BEARING FIGURES  AND WOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO SAY THAT THESE FUST MEN OR DEMONS  N AND SUCH PHRENESIA FUST EFFECT OF SLEEPING AWAKE OR AWAKE SLEEP   OF LANCRY    THE WALKS OF THE FARNEDO HAD NOT STOPPED  ONLY MADAME ALBERTI TOOK CARE TO START THEM EARLY  AND RETURN TO TRIESTE BEFORE THE END OF THE DAY  THE SEASON WAS FIERY  AND THE SHADE OF THE OAKS BARELY MAINTAINED ENOUGH FRESHNESS TO TEMPER THE HEAT OF THE SUN  WHEN THE WIND AFRICA WAS BLOWING ON THE GULF  HUGE YELLOW CLOUDS DULL  AND YET DAZZLING  GATHER IN A PART OF THE SKY  ROLL AND FALL FROM THEIR GIGANTIC PEAKS  LIKE AVALANCHES OF FIRE  SPREAD  FLATTEN AND SETTLE  A DULL NOISE ACCOMPANIES THEM AND CEASES WHEN THEY STOP  THEN THE ALL OF NATURE REMAINS CHAINED WITH TERROR  LIKE A THREATENED ANIMAL OF HIS DESTRUCTION  WHICH TAKES ON THE ASPECT OF DEATH FOR HIM ESCAPE  THERE IS NOT A LEAF THAT QUIVERS  NOT AN INSECT WHICH RUSTLES UNDER THE STILL GRASS  IF WE TURN OUR EYES TO THE PLACE WHERE THE SUN MUST BE  WE SEE FLOATING IN A COLUMN OBLIQUE OF LUMINOUS ATOMS THE IMPALPABLE DUST THAT THE SIROCCO HAS TAKEN FROM THE DESERT  AND WHOSE ORIGIN CAN BE RECOGNIZED BY ITS SHADE OF BRICK RED  NO MOVEMENT  MOREOVER  CAN BE SEEN  EXCEPT THAT OF THE KITE WHICH DESCRIBES  AT THE TOP OF THE FIRMAMENT  ITS CIRCULAR FLIGHT  MARKING FROM AFAR  IN THE SAND  ITS PREY OVERWHELMED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THIS FORMIDABLE ATMOSPHERE  NO VOICE THAT IS HEARD  IF NOT THE SHRILL AND PLAINTIVE CRY OF CARNIVOROUS ANIMALS  WHICH  FILLED WITH A FEROCIOUS INSTINCT  AND BELIEVING IN THE LAST DAY OF THE WORLD  COME TO CLAIM THE DEBRIS OF CREATED BEINGS THAT WERE PROMISED TO THEM  THE MAN HIMSELF  DESPITE HIS MORAL POWER  YIELD TO THAT POWER AGAINST WHICH HE HAS NEVER TRIED HIS FACULTIES  HIS NOBLE FOREHEAD LEANS TOWARDS THE EARTH  ITS LIMBS WEAKEN AND GIVE WAY UNDER IT  WITHOUT COURAGE AND WITHOUT SPRING  HE FALLS AND WAITS  IN A LANGUOR INVINCIBLE  LET A SOFTER AIR REVIVE IT  RESTORE MOVEMENT TO HIS SPIRITS  WARMTH TO HIS BLOOD  AND LIFE TO NATURE    MRS  ALBERTI OFTEN RESTED WITH ANTONIA  UNDER A GROUP TREES  IN A PRETTY PLACE WHERE YOU CAN DISCOVER PART OF TRIESTE  TO THE CHURCH OF THE GREEKS  AND WHERE THE EARTH IS COATED SHORT  COOL GRASS THAT INVITES YOU TO SLEEP  ANTONIA  WHOSE DELICATE ORGANS DID NOT RESIST THE IMPRESSION OF SIROCCO  HAD FALLEN ASLEEP  AND HIS SISTER WAS WALKING A FEW PACES AWAY  INSIDE HIM MAKING A GARLAND OF SMALL BLUE SPEEDWELLS  IN THE MANNER GIRLS FROM ISTRIA  WHO BRAID THEM WITH GREAT ART  AS SHE LACKED SOME TO COMPLETE IT  SHE HAD WALKED IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS OUT OF THE ENCLOSURE WHERE ANTONIA LAY  AND WHEN SHE REALIZED THAT SHE HAD COME OUT OF IT  THE EFFORTS THAT SHE HAD DONE TO FIND HER HAD TAKEN HER AWAY MORE  AT FIRST SHE HAD LAUGHED AT HER MISTAKE  LIKE A ACCIDENT WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE  THEN SHE WAS A LITTLE WORRIED  AND HIS ANXIETY  WHICH MADE HIS WALK MORE HASTY  THE ALSO MADE IT MORE UNCERTAIN  FINALLY  WORRY HAD MADE PLACE TO A MORE PAINFUL FEELING  BUT WHICH WAS TO GIVE WAY TO REFLECTION  THERE WAS A SURE WAY TO FIND ANTONIA  IT WAS TO CALL HIM WITH FORCE  BUT A CRY WOULD HAVE DISTURBED HIS REST  AND NOT WITHOUT DANGER FOR THIS LIVELY AND SENSITIVE ORGANIZATION  THAT THE SLIGHTEST UNEXPECTED EMOTION ALWAYS OFFENDED  WHAT ELSE NATURAL TO THINK  ON THE CONTRARY  THAT ANTONIA  AWAKE  WOULD CALL HER SISTER  BEFORE SHE GOT SCARED OF HER ABSENCE  AT THIS IDEA  MRS  ALBERTI  REASSURED  SAT DOWN AND CONTINUED HER GARLAND    DURING THIS TIME  ANTONIA HAD INDEED WOKEN UP  A NOISE LIGHT THAT WAS HEARD IN FRONT OF HER  IN THE FOLIAGE  HAD INTERRUPTED HIS SLEEP  AND HIS EYELID HAD HALF RAISED UNDER THE ONE OF HIS ARMS WHICH WRAPPED HIS HEAD  THROUGH THE CURLS OF HER HAIR  WHICH COVERED PART OF HER FACE SHE HAD GLIMPSED  BUT IN A WAY THAT THE WEAKNESS OF HER SIGHT MADE MORE VAGUE AND MORE ALARMING  TWO MEN WHO WATCHED ATTENTIVELY  ONE OF THEM  AS THOUGH VEILED FROM A WIDE PLUME THAT FELL ON HIS FACE  RESTED ON THE OTHER  WHICH WAS KNEELING AT HIS FEET  LEGS CROSSED UNDER HIM  IN THE ATTITUDE OF THE RAGUSANS AT REST  ANTONIA  SEIZED WITH FEAR  CLOSED HER EYES AND HELD HER BREATH  SO AS NOT TO LET RECOGNIZE THE AGITATION SHE WAS EXPERIENCING BY THE MOVEMENT OF HER BREAST     THERE SHE IS    SAID ONE OF THESE STRANGERS    HERE IS THE GIRL FROM THE HOUSE MONTELEONE  WHO FIXED THE FATE OF MY LIFE      MASTER    REPLIED THE OTHER    YOU SAID THE SAME ABOUT THE DAUGHTER OF THE BEY OF THE MOUNTAINS  TO WHOM WE KILLED SO MANY PEOPLE  AND OF THE FAVORITE SLAVE OF THIS TURKISH DOG  WHO MADE US PAY SO DEAR THE FORTRESS OF CZETIM  BY SAINT NICHOLAS  IF WE HAD WANTED TO DO THE SAME TO REDUCE WALLACHIA  YOU WOULD BE NOW HOSPODAR  AND WE WOULDN T NEED         SHUT UP  ZISKA    REPLIED THE ONE WHO HAD SPOKEN FIRST    YOUR RIDICULOUS EXCLAMATIONS WILL WAKE HER FROM HER SLEEP  AND I WILL BE DEPRIVED OF THE HAPPINESS OF SEEING HER  WHICH I MAY NOT ENJOY ANYMORE  BE CAREFUL NOT TO STIR THE AIR CIRCULATING AROUND HER  BECAUSE I PUNISH EVEN ON YOUR OLD FATHER  WHO WEEPS SO BITTERLY TO HAVE GIVEN BIRTH TO YOU  YOU LAUGH  ZISKA     ANTONIA IS BEAUTIFUL         NOT BAD    SAID ZISKA    BUT NOT ENOUGH TO EFFEMINATE A HEART MAN  AND TO STOP A TROOP OF BRAVE MEN IN A FOREST OF PLEASURE CRAFT  WHERE THERE IS NO WATER TO DRINK  MASTER    HE CONTINUED  GETTING UP    WHERE DO YOU WANT ME TO WEAR THIS CHILD      ANTONIA TREMBLED  AND  DESPITE HERSELF  HER ARM FELL ON HER BREAST      WRETCHED    RESUMED ZISKA S MASTER IN A HOLLOW VOICE    WHO ASKED YOU FOR YOUR EXECRABLE SERVICES  DO YOU KNOW THAT THIS GIRL IS MY WIFE BEFORE GOD  AND THAT I SWORE THAT NEVER A HAND MORTAL WOULD NOT DETACH A SINGLE JEWEL FROM HER VIRGIN CROWN  NOT EVEN MINE  ZISKA  NO  I WILL NEVER HAVE A COMMON BED WITH HER ON EARTH     WHAT AM I SAYING  AH  IF I KNEW THAT MY LIPS ONE DAY PROFANED THOSE INNOCENT LIPS  WHICH WERE NEVER HALF OPEN THAT IN THE CHASTE KISSES OF A FATHER  I WOULD BURN THEM WITH A FIERY IRON  OUR YOUTH WERE CRADLED IN IDEAS VIOLENT AND FIERCE  BUT THIS YOUNG GIRL IS SACRED TO MY LOVE  AND I TAKE CARE OF THE CONSERVATION OF THE LEAST OF HIS HAIR     MY SOUL CLINGS TO HER  HOVERS OVER HER  YOU SEE  AND FOLLOWS HER TO THROUGH THIS SHORT LIFE  IN THE MIDST OF ALL THE PITFALLS OF MEN AND DESTINY  WITHOUT HER NOTICING ME FOR A MOMENT  IT IS MY CONQUEST OF ETERNITY  AND SINCE I LOST MY EXISTENCE  SINCE I AM FORBIDDEN TO SHARE IT WITH A SWEET AND NOBLE CREATURE LIKE THIS  I TAKE IT FOR EVERYTHING THE FUTURE  I SWEAR BY THE SLEEP SHE TASTES NOW THAT HER LAST SLEEP WILL REUNITE US  AND SHE WILL SLEEP NEAR ME UNTIL THE EARTH IS RENEWED   ANTONIA S TROUBLE DID NOT STOP INCREASING  BUT HE BEGAN TO INTERFERE WITH CURIOSITY AND INTEREST  SHE WANTED TO LOOK  HER SIGHT TOO WEAK SERVED HER BADLY  SHE GENTLY RAISED HER HEAD  THE STRANGERS WALKED AWAY  SHE STOOD UP COMPLETELY  AND FIXED HER EYES ON THE PLACE WHERE SHE HAD HEARD THEM  THERE WAS ONLY ONE LEFT WHO SLIPPED BENT UNDER THE BUSHES  HE WAS HIDEOUS    THE STRANGERS HAD HARDLY DISAPPEARED WHEN MADAME ALBERTI  WARNED BY SOME NOISE  ARRIVED AT THE FOOT OF THE OAK UNDER WHICH ANTONIA HAD FALLEN ASLEEP  SHE LISTENED TO HIS STORY WITHOUT BELIEVING IT  ANTONIA HIM HAD GIVEN TOO MUCH EVIDENCE OF THE WEAKNESS OF HIS REASON  TO WHETHER SHE SUSPECTED ANYTHING OTHER THAN A VISION OR ILLUSION OF THINK ABOUT WHAT SHE WAS TELLING  BUT LIKE THIS IDEA EVEN HIM INSPIRED A REMARKABLE TENDERNESS  HIS SISTER WAS MISTAKEN ABOUT THE NATURE OF HIS EMOTION  SHE ATTRIBUTED TO THE COMPASSION AROUSED BY A GREAT PERIL IS THE PITY WHICH ARISES FROM A GREAT DELUSION OF MIND  SHE SURRENDERED WITH ABANDON TO THE IDEAS SHE HAD CONCEIVED  AND THIS HABITUAL PREOCCUPATION TOOK  AS MUCH AS IT COULD TAKE ON  THE CHARACTER OF A MANIA   WHAT  POOR UNFORTUNATE WOMAN    CRIED MADAME ALBERTI AT LAST    WHO DO YOU CONVINCE YOURSELF YOU ARE LOVED  FROM ONE OF JEAN SBOGAR S LIEUTENANTS  GOD FORGIVE ME      FROM JEAN SBOGAR    RESUMED ANTONIA  STEPPING BACK  AS IF SHE HAD STEPPED ON A VIPER       THAT IS PROBABLE      IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE  ACCORDING TO THIS  TO RETURN TO THE FARNEDO  ANTONIA HARDLY LEFT THE HOUSE  ONLY WHEN ITS A CALMER MIND HADN T BEEN TROUBLED BY A FEW OF THESE TERRORS WHOSE OBJECT PASSED FOR IMAGINARY  SHE WENT  ALONE  BREATHE THE COOL EVENING BREEZE ON THE HARBOR  SOMETIMES SHE STOPPED UNDER THE WALLS OF THE SAINT CHARLES PALACE  AND SHE SOUGHT TO DISCOVER  FROM THERE  THIS CASTLE OF DUINO  OF WHICH HIS FATHER AND HIS SISTER HAD SPOKEN TO HIM SO OFTEN  ARRIVED AT THE PIER WHICH IS APPROACHING  SHE ADVANCED MECHANICALLY ALONG THE ROAD  TO THE PLACE WHERE IT ENDS IN A SMALL HIGH WORK  COVERED  ON THE SEA SIDE  WITH A NARROW BENCH  WHICH CANNOT RECEIVE CONVENIENTLY ONLY ONE PERSON  THIS LONELINESS  PLACED BETWEEN AN INHABITED CITY AND THE DESERTED SEA  PLEASED HIS IMAGINATION AND DID NOT FRIGHTEN HIM  SHE LOVED TO SEE  AFTER A DAY NEBULA  THE SENSITIVE FLOW OF THE GULF  WHEN ITS SLATE FACE SUDDENLY BREAKS FROM SPACE TO SPACE  THE FROTHY BENCHES RUSH ONE OVER THE OTHER TO THE SHORE  LET THE WAVE RISE  WHITENS AND FALLS BACK UNDER THE WAVE THAT FOLLOWS IT  WHICH ENVELOPS IT AND DRAGS HIM INTO A WAVE FURTHER AWAY  WHILE THE GULLS RISE AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE  COME DOWN ROLLING ON THEMSELVES  LIKE THE SPINDLE OF A SHEPHERDESS SLIPPING FROM HER HAND  BRUSH AGAINST THE WATER  LIFT IT OFF THE WING  OR APPEAR TO RUN OVER ITS SURFACE  ONE NIGHT THAT SHE HAD STAYED THERE LONGER THAN USUAL  RETAINED BY THE CHARM OF THE NIGHT  WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN OF A MORE SERENITY PURE AND LIT BY A RESPLENDENT MOON  SHE TOOK PLEASURE TO SEE THE LIGHT OF THIS PEACEFUL STAR EXTENDING FROM THE TOP MOUNTAINS IN SILVERY SHEETS  WASHED WITH A LIGHT TINT BLUISH  AND MARRY THE EARTH  THE SEA AND THE SKY  FLOODED WITH ITS STILL CLARITY  THE SILENCE OF THE COAST  INTERRUPTED ONLY HOUR BY HOUR BY THE SIGNALS OF THE MARINE GUARDS  LEFT HEAR THE QUIVERING OF THE WATER THAT WAS COMING TO DIE IN FRONT OF ANTONIA  AND THE BEATING OF A SMALL BOAT ATTACHED TO THE END OF THE MOLE  WHICH THE WAVES PUSHED BACK AT EQUAL INTERVALS AGAINST THE FOOT OF THE ROAD  HIS THOUGHT  PLUNGED INTO A WAVE INFINITE  LIKE THE ELEMENT THAT PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIS EYES  HAD LOST SEEN THE WORLD  WHEN A SUDDEN FEELING OF DREAD RETURNED ALL ITS ALARMS  THIS FEELING  LIGHTNING FAST  DETERMINED BY AN INEXPLICABLE CONNECTION OF IDEAS  IT WAS THE REMEMBER WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM ON HIS LAST WALK IN THE FARNEDO  OF THE INCOMPREHENSIBLE APPEARANCE OF THIS MAN WHO HAD ARROGATED ABSOLUTE POWER OVER HIS LIFE  SUCH IS THE EMPIRE OF IMAGINATION  THAT SHE IMMEDIATELY PICTURED THIS SCENE  AND THAT AT THE END OF A CLIMB  ALL HIS SENSES  EQUALLY DECEIVED  GAVE WAY TO THE MOST COMPLETE ILLUSION  SHE STILL THOUGHT SHE SAW AND HEAR  A BRIGHT LIGHT  PART OF DUINO  AND FOLLOWED BY DULL EXPLOSION  DESTROYED PRESTIGE  BUT THE IMPRESSION REMAINED  ANTONIA S HEART WAS BEATING VIOLENTLY  A SWEAT COLD RAN DOWN HIS FOREHEAD  HIS WORRIED GAZE SOUGHT TO RIGHT AND LEFT AN OBJECT SHE WAS AFRAID TO SEE  HIS EAR LISTENED IN SILENCE  AND WAS IMPATIENT WITH ITS CONTINUITY SORRY  SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO BE DISTRACTED FROM THIS TERROR WITHOUT OBJECT BY A REASONABLE CAUSE OF FEAR  BY DINT OF ATTENTION  SHE THOUGHT SHE NOTICED THAT THEY WERE TALKING IN AN UNDERTONE TO HER  SHE GOT UP AND SAT DOWN  HIS LEGS WERE SHAKING  THE VOICES TOOK ON A LITTLE MORE STRENGTH  BUT THEY CAME CLOSER  SHE BELIEVED RECOGNIZE THE ACCENT OF THIS RAGUSAIN WHO HAD PROPOSED TO REMOVE IT DE LA FOR T  WHERE DO YOU WANT ME TO CARRY THIS CHILD  AND THE SAME INSTANT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT WE WERE PRONOUNCING MORE OR LESS THE SAME LYRICS  SHE COULD HARDLY CONVINCE HERSELF THAT HER SENSES DID NOT WERE NOT DECEIVED BY A DREAM  SHE LEANED DOWN TO HEAR BETTER  THESE WORDS WERE NOT FINISHED  OR THEY WERE REPEATED  THEY DISTINCTLY HIT HIS EAR      RATHER DIE  ANSWERED A HIGHER VOICE  WHICH WAS MOREOVER CLOSER TO HER  SHE JUDGED THAT SHE WAS NOT SEPARATED FROM THE MAN WHO SPOKE ONLY BY THE NARROW ANGLE THAT THE WALL PROJECTED ONTO THE ROADWAY  A LITTLE MORE  SHE WOULD HAVE FELT THE AIR STIRRED BY HIS BREATH  SHE QUICKLY TURNED TO THE OTHER END OF THE BENCH  AND  DURING THIS MOVEMENT  SHE SAW TWO MEN WHO RUSHED INTO THE LITTLE BOAT  AND WHO WERE ROWING FORCE  THE MOON WAS HIDDEN BEHIND CLOUDS OF A PEARL GRAY  WHICH GRADUALLY TORE INTO THICK FLAKES  A DIE ITS RAYS FELL ON THE BASKET  AND LIT A WHITE FEATHER ABANDONED TO THE WINDS  WHICH SHADED THE HAT OF ONE OF THE TRAVELERS  ANTONIA COULD HARDLY MAKE OUT ANYTHING  EAGER TO REGAIN THE CITY  SHE WALKED IN TWO OR THREE MINUTES THE LENGTH OF THE ROADWAY  AND PASSED LIKE A SHADOW BESIDE THE SENTRY WHO WAS RESTING ON HIS ESCOPETTE      GOD SAVE YOU  SIGNORA   HE SAID TO HER    IT S GETTING LATE FOR  YOUNG LADIES      I THOUGHT I WAS ALONE ON THE PIER    SHE REPLIED     SO YOU WERE THERE ALONE   REPLIED THE SOLDIER    AND SINCE A HOUR  A LIVING SOUL HAS NOT APPROACHED IT  UNLESS IT IS THE DEMON OR JEAN SBOGAR      HEAVEN PRESERVE US FROM JEAN SBOGAR    CRIED ANTONIA      GOD IS LISTENING TO YOU  SAID THE SOLDIER  CROSSING HIMSELF    AT THE SAME MOMENT THE CANNON SOUNDED FOR THE SECOND TIME ON THE SIDE OF DUINO    THIS NEW ACCOUNT OF ANTONIA WAS NOT GREETED WITH MORE TRUST THAT THE FIRST  IT WAS TOO VISIBLE THAT THE ATTENTION COMPASSIONATE AND PAINFUL THAT WE PRETENDED TO GRANT HIM HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE INTEREST OF CONVICTION  STRUCK BY THIS IDEA  SHE INSISTED WITH A NOBLE CALM THAT ASTONISHED MADAME ALBERTI  BUT WHO DID NOT PERSUADE HER  ANTONIA  LEFT ALONE  COVERED HER EYES WITH HER HANDS  AND REFLECTED ON HER SITUATION WITH A DEEP BITTERNESS  THE OPINION SHE HAD FORMED FROM CHILDHOOD  THE SINGULARITY OF ITS ORGANIZATION AND THE STATE OF DISGRACE IN WHICH NATURE HAD GIVEN BIRTH TO HIM  CONFIRMED BY THE FEELING THAT SHE AROUSED AROUND HER  FIXED IN FRONT OF HER MIND  AND DEVELOPED TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE THIS EXTREME DISPOSITION TO MISTRUST AND FEAR  WHICH FORMED THE BASIS OF ITS CHARACTER  HIS WEAKNESS WAS A KIND OF MORAL ILLNESS  WHICH IS NOT DIFFICULT TO CURE WITH PROPER CARE OF WHICH MADAME ALBERTI WAS CAPABLE  BUT THIS ONE SAW SOMETHING ELSE THING  AND HIS PREVENTION HAD INCREASED IN THIS RESPECT BY ALL EFFORTS SHE HAD MADE TO OVERCOME IT  ANTONIA WAS HIS ONE THOUGHT  HOPE  LOVE AND PURPOSE OF HIS LIFE  TO LOSE THIS GIRL LOVED BY DEATH  OR SEE HER DELIGHTED WITH PROJECTS WHICH SHE HAD FOUNDED ON HER BY AN INCURABLE DELUSION OF MIND  IT WAS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME  AND WHEN IT HAD TAKEN PLACE DREADING THIS LAST MISFORTUNE  SHE HAD DONE EVERYTHING TO PERSUADE THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE  IN THE FATAL ERROR OF HIS TENDERNESS  SHE REPELLED THE SUSPICION THAT OBSESSED HER WELL  BECAUSE THAT HE WOULD HAVE KILLED HER  BUT THERE WAS TOO MUCH DANGER IN IT TO CONSIDER IT FACE TO FACE  TO DISCUSS IT COLDLY  TO REALIZE IT FINALLY  SO THAT SHE WOULD DARE TO UNDERTAKE IT  SHE HAD MANAGED TO TO DISTRACT HIMSELF FROM IT  AND NOT TO CHASE IT AWAY  HIS IMAGINATION VIVID AND ABSOLUTE  MOREOVER  IN ALL THE IDEAS SHE HAD OF THE THINGS  AND WHICH ATTACHED  BY AN INVOLUNTARY PREFERENCE AND INVINCIBLE  TO THOSE WHO WERE MOST PAINFUL TO BELIEVE  DO NOT HARDLY EVER CHANGED THE WAY SHE HAD SEEN THEM ONCE  THE TWO SISTERS THEREFORE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITH A MUTUAL AFFECTION  ARISING IN ONE FROM AN EXCESS OF SHYNESS  IN THE OTHER FROM AN EXCESS OF SOLICITUDE WHICH MADE THEM ALSO UNHAPPY      V     MY GOD  YOU WILL NOT BE CONFUSED IN THE RIGORS OF YOUR JUSTICE THE INNOCENT WITH THE GUILTY  HIT  HIT THAT HEAD LONG CONDEMNED  SHE DEVOTES HERSELF TO YOUR JUDGMENTS  BUT SPARE THIS WOMAN AND THIS CHILD WHO ARE ALONE IN THE MIDST OF DIFFICULT AND PERILOUS WAYS OF THE WORLD  IS HE NOT AMONG THESE PURE INTELLIGENCE  FIRST WORK OF YOUR HANDS  SOME ANGEL BENEVOLENT  FAVORABLE TO INNOCENCE AND WEAKNESS  WHO DEIGN TO STICK TO THEIR FOOTSTEPS  IN THE FORM OF THE PILGRIM  FOR TO PRESERVE THE STORMS OF THE SEA  AND TO DIVERT THE IRON FROM THEIR HEARTS SHARP BANDITS   TRAVELER S PRAYER    AT THAT TIME  SOME VERY IMPORTANT BUSINESS  WHICH THEIR FATHER HAD LEFT TO SETTLE IN VENICE  REQUESTED THE PRESENCE OF MADAME ALBERTI  SHE REGARDED THIS CIRCUMSTANCE AS THE HAPPIEST WHO COULD ARRIVE IN THE STATE OF ANTONIA  AND AGAIN PERSUADED HIMSELF THAT THE UNFORTUNATE IMPRESSIONS WHICH HAD ALTERED HIS JUDGMENT  AND WHICH SEEMED TO DEPEND ON THE INFLUENCE OF PLACES AND MEMORIES  WOULD FINALLY GIVE WAY TO A TOTAL CHANGE OF HABIT AND KIND OF LIFE  THE GREAT FORTUNE THEY ENJOYED ALLOWED TO OBTAIN  IN THIS OPULENT CITY AND MAGNIFICENT  ALL THE PLEASURES THAT LUXURY AND THE ARTS BRING TOGETHER FROM ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD  AND THIS NEW KIND OF EMOTION  WHICH APPEALS MORE TO THE IMAGINATION THAN TO THE SENSITIVITY  OFFERED INFINITELY LESS DANGER TO AN IRRITABLE SOUL THAN THOSE WHO RESULT FROM THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE NATURAL BEAUTIES OF THE UNIVERSE  WHOSE IMPOSING GRANDEUR OVERWHELMS THOUGHT  VENICE TRIP WAS THEREFORE RESOLVED  AND ANTONIA HAD NEVER RECEIVED ANY NEWS WITH MORE JOY  TRIESTE HAD BECOME FOR HER A PALACE MAGIC  WHERE  CONSTANTLY OBSERVED BY INVISIBLE SPIES  SHE LIVED AT THE MERCY OF AN UNKNOWN TYRANT  ABSOLUTE MASTER OF HIS FREEDOM AND OF HIS LIFE  WHICH SEVERAL TIMES HAD BALKED AT REMOVING IT FROM AMONG HER OWN  TO TRANSPORT HER TO A NEW WORLD  SHE DID NOT FORM AN IDEA WITHOUT SHUDDERING  AND WHO WAS PERHAPS ON THE EVE OF ACCOMPLISHING THIS FATAL RESOLUTION  IF PROVIDENCE DID NOT HIDE IT FROM HIS EYES  THE HOPE OF BEING DELIVERED FROM THIS SUBJECT OF TERROR ACTED PROMPTLY ON HER  AND RETURNED HER OF DAYS THIS FRESHNESS AND THIS GRACE OF YOUTH THAT ANXIETY HAD LONG WITHERED  THE SMILE REAPPEARED ON HIS LIPS  SERENITY ON HIS FOREHEAD  MORE EXPANSIVE CONFIDENCE  A SWEETER ABANDON REIGNED IN HER SPEECHES  AND MADAME ALBERTI  DELIGHTED THAT THE MERE APPROACH OF DEPARTURE PRODUCED SUCH EFFECTS ABLE TO JUSTIFY HIS CONJECTURES  NEGLECTED NOTHING HASTEN EVEN MORE  THE LACK OF SECURITY OF PUBLIC ROADS HOWEVER DEMANDED THAT IT BE PUT BACK TO A FIXED DAY WHEN BROUGHT TOGETHER ALL THE TRAVELERS HEADING TOWARDS THE SAME PERIOD  TO USE EACH OTHER AS AN ESCORT  THE CAR OF MADAME ALBERTI WAS THE NINTH TO THE MEETING  ON THE SANDY PLATFORM OF OPSCHINA  FROM WHERE THE EYE EMBRACES IN THE DISTANCE THE GULF AND UNEVEN DUNES WITH WHICH ITS LONG CIRCUIT IS BRISTLING  ANTONIA AND HER SISTER WERE ACCOMPANIED BY A CHAPLAIN  A MAN BUSINESSMEN  A TRUSTED OLD SERVANT  AND TWO WOMEN  THERE WAS A VACANT PLACE IN THE INTERIOR  THE DAY WAS ALREADY ADVANCED  BECAUSE THE BORA  WHICH HAD BLOWN IN THE MORNING  HAD FEARS ONE OF THOSE HURRICANES THAT WE NEVER BRAVE WITH IMPUNITY ON THE HIGH COASTS OF ISTRIA  FROM WHERE THEY REMOVE THE LOADS THE HEAVIEST  THAT THEY ROLL TO THE BOTTOM OF THE ABYSS  THIS CARAVAN WAS MOREOVER LARGE ENOUGH THAT THERE WAS NO OF REASONABLE FEAR TO CONCEIVE ROBBERS  EVEN WHEN ONE IS WOULD FIND HIMSELF SURPRISED BY THE DARKEST NIGHT  AND WE SHOULD SLEEP ONLY IN MONTEFALCONE  WHICH IS A FEW LEAGUES AWAY  ON THE POETIC EDGES OF THE TIMAVE  THE EVENING WAS SUDDENLY EMBELLISHED  THE AIR WAS FRESH AND PURE  THE SKY CLOUDLESS  THE CREWS FOLLOWED EACH OTHER SLOWLY ON STEEP SLOPES AND PLANERS FROM THE BACK OF THE MOUNTAINS OF TRIESTE  THROUGH VAST THICKETS STREWN WITH ROCKS WHICH RAISE THEIR SHARP PEAKS HERE AND THERE AND GATHERING IN A SHORT  ARID FOAM  THE ONLY GREENERY THAT WE NOTICE IS THAT OF THE LUSTROUS LEAF OF THE HOLLY  AND A FEW BRAMBLES DRAGGING THEIR THORNY ARMS ON THE SAND  AT FOOT OF THE COAST ONE SEES A GROUP OF HOUSES OF THE SADDER  WHOSE ROOFS  LADEN WITH ENORMOUS STONES  ATTEST THE RAVAGES OF THE BORA  BY THE OFTEN UNNECESSARY OBSTACLES THAT MULTIPLIES AGAINST HER  IN ALL THE PLACES WHERE SHE IS ACCUSTOMED TO UNLEASH  IT WAS THE HAMLET OF SESTIANA  POPULATED BY SAILORS AND OF FISHERMEN    WHILE THE HORSES WERE RELAXING FROM THE LONG EFFORT THEY HAD OPPOSED THE WEIGHT THAT WAS FALLING ON THEM  IN A PATH SLIPPERY AND SWIFT  SESTIANA S OLD HOST LEANED AGAINST THE DOOR OF MADAME ALBERTI S CAR  AND PRAYED TO HER  IN THE NAME OF CHRISTIAN CHARITY  TO RECEIVE AS FAR AS MONTEFALCONE A POOR TRAVELER OVERWHELMED WITH FATIGUE  WHO COULD NOT CONTINUE HIS JOURNEY  HE WAS A YOUNG MONK FROM THE ARMENIAN CONVENT OF THE LAGOONS OF VENICE  WHO WAS RETURNING FROM THE MISSION  AND WHOSE GENTLE AND HONEST FACE HAD INSPIRED THE KEENEST INTEREST  THIS PRAYER WAS ONE OF THOSE THAT MADAME ALBERTI AND HER SISTER WOULD NEVER HAVE REJECTED  WHATEVER REASON THEY HAD FOR DOING SO  THE DOOR OPENED  AND THE ARMENIAN  SUPPORTED BY THE GOOD OLD MAN WHO HAD PRESENTED  SET FOOT ON THE STEPS OF THE COACH  AFTER HAVING STAMMERED A FEW WORDS OF THANKS  AND LIFTED HIMSELF PAINFULLY TOWARDS THE PLACE WHICH WAS INTENDED FOR HIM  HIS SOFT WHITE HAND LIKE THAT OF A YOUNG GIRL ACCIDENTALLY LEANED ON MADAME ALBERTI  BUT HE HASTILY WITHDREW HER  AND  RECOGNIZING THAT THE CAR WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY OCCUPIED BY WOMEN  HE FOLDED DOWN OVER HIS FACE THE ENORMOUS WINGS OF HIS ROUND FELT  BEFORE BEING SEEN  SOON AFTER WE RECOVERED WORKING  NIGHT HAD COMPLETELY FALLEN BY THEN    THE GAP FROM SESTIANA TO DUINO IS FILLED BY A LIGHT STRIKE OF FINE AND MOBILE SAND  WHICH LEAKS FROM ALL SIDES UNDER THE WHEELS  AND IN WHICH THE CAR  RISING AND SINKING IN TURN  SEEMS AGITATED BY A RIPPLING MOVEMENT SIMILAR TO THAT OF WAVES  A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT INCREASES THIS PRESTIGE IN THE LIGHT FALSE AND MISLEADING OF THE EVENING STARS  IT IS THE BRILLIANT COLOR OF THE SILVER ARENA  AND THE VAGUE EXPANSE OF THE HORIZON  WHICH  LESS CIRCUMSCRIBED THAT DURING THE DAY  IS PROLONGED OF ANY THE UNCERTAINTY OF ITS DARKNESS  AND PRESENTS TO THE EYES SOME FROM THE VAST SEA  IT SEEMS THEN THAT THE HORSES HAVE DESCENDED IN A FORD AND TRAVERSE A SPACE FLOODED BY THE WATERS OF MOUNTAINS  ANTONIA  WHO WAS IN ONE OF THE CORNERS OF THE CAR  HAD LIFTED THE ICE ON HIS SIDE  AND ENJOYED  BREATHING THE AIR COLD BUT ENERGETIC OF THE NIGHT  OF THIS KIND OF ILLUSION  THE DIFFICULTY IN WALKING HORSES ON FLEETING AND DEEP GROUND WHO SLIPPED UNDER THEIR FEET AT ALL TIMES HAD THEM EXTREMELY SLOWED DOWN  AND THE SLIGHTEST EXTERNAL AGITATION WAS NOTICED  SEVERAL TIMES ANTONIA  WHO WAS ONLY TOO WILLING TO GRAB ALL MATTERS OF CONCERN  HAD BELIEVED TO SEE SHADOWS OF A SINGULAR FORM TO SLIP INTO THE INDECISIVE SPACE THAT STRETCHED IN FRONT OF HER  AND  TROUBLED  SHE HAD HELD HER BREATH  TO TO KNOW IF THIS MOVEMENT WAS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY SOME NOISE  THIS WHICH MUST UNDOUBTEDLY BE IF IT RESULTED FROM SOMETHING OTHER THAN FROM A SIMPLE MISTAKE IN HIS SIGHT  SUDDENLY THE POSTILION  WHO PERHAPS WAS EXPERIENCING SOMETHING SIMILAR  OR FEARED TO GIVE IN TO SLEEP  BEGAN TO SING A DALMATIAN PISME  A SORT OF ROMANCE THAT IS NOT WITHOUT CHARM WHEN THE EAR IS THERE ACCUSTOMED  BUT WHICH SURPRISES HIM BY HIS EXTRAORDINARY CHARACTER AND WILD WHEN IT IS HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME  AND WHOSE MODULATIONS ARE SO BIZARRE IN TASTE THAT THE ONLY INHABITANTS OF COUNTRIES HAVE THE SECRET  THE SONG IS EXTREMELY SIMPLE HOWEVER  BECAUSE IT ONLY CONSISTS OF ONE PATTERN REPEATED ENDLESSLY  ACCORDING TO THE USAGE OF PRIMITIVE PEOPLES  AND OF TWO OR THREE SOUNDS MORE THAT COME BACK IN THE SAME ORDER  WHAT IS THERE INCOMPREHENSIBLE  IT IS THE VERY SPECIES OF THESE SOUNDS  WHICH DO NOT APPEAR TO PROCEED FROM THE VOICE OF A MAN  AND OF WHICH AN ARTIFICE ANALOGOUS TO THAT OF THOSE JUGGLERS IN FRANCE  WHO ARE CALLED VENTRILOQUISTS  BUT WHICH IS NATURAL TO THE ILLYRIAN SINGER  CHANGES TO ANY MOMENT THE EXPRESSION  THE VOLUME  THE PLACE OF SENSITIVE ORIGIN  IT IS A SUCCESSIVE AND RAPID IMITATION OF THE MOST SEVERE  SHRILL CRIES  AND ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT THE INHABITANT DESERTED PLACES COLLECTS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHTS IN THE RUMOR OF WINDS  IN THE WHISTLING OF STORMS  IN THE HOWLING OF TERRIFIED ANIMALS  IN THIS CONCERT OF COMPLAINTS WHICH LONELY FORESTS AT THE ONSET OF A HURRICANE  WHEN EVERYTHING TAKES IN NATURE A VOICE TO MOAN  UP TO THE BRANCH THAT THE WIND BROKE  WITHOUT DETACHING IT ENTIRELY FROM THE TREE TO WHICH IT BELONGS  AND WHICH SWINGS SHOUTING SUSPENDED FROM A REST BARK  SOMETIMES THE FULL AND SONOROUS VOICE RESOUNDS WITHOUT OBSTACLE AROUND LISTENERS  SOMETIMES YOU WOULD THINK IT RESONATES UNDER A VAULT  AND SOMETIMES THE AIR TAKES IT BEYOND THE CLOUDS AND LEADS IT ASTRAY IN BOTH  WHERE IT IMBUES IT WITH A CHARM THAT NEVER TASTED IN HUMAN MELODIES  HOWEVER THIS MUSIC AIR DOES NOT HAVE THE PURITY SO CALM AND SO SUITABLE TO REST THE SOUL THAT WE ATTRIBUTE TO THOSE OF THE ANGELS  EVEN WHEN SHE IS APPROACH  IT IS  ON THE CONTRARY  SEVERE AT THE HEART OF MAN  BECAUSE THE THOUGHT THAT IT AWAKENS IS FULL OF TUMULTUOUS MEMORIES  PASSIONATE FEELINGS  WORRIES AND OF REGRETS  BUT IT ATTACHES  IT LEADS  IT SUBJUGATES ATTENTION  WHICH CANNOT FREE ITSELF FROM ITS EMPIRE  SHE S CALLING BACK THOSE FORMIDABLE AND GENTLE ACCORDS OF THE MARINE DIVINITIES  WHICH BOUND TRAVELERS AND WHO LURED THEIR SHIP INTO THE REEFS INEVITABLE  THE STRANGER ENDOWED WITH A LIVELY IMAGINATION  WHO  SEATED ON THE SHORES OF DALMATIA  ONLY ONCE HEARD THE YOUNG MORLAQUE GIRL TO EXHALE HER EVENING SONG  AND DELIVER HER ACCENTS THAT NO ART CAN TEACH  THAT NO INSTRUMENT WILL NEVER IMITATE  THAT NO WORD CAN DESCRIBE  COULD UNDERSTAND THE WONDER OF THE SIRENS OF THE ODYSSEY  AND HE APOLOGIZED  WITH A SMILE  ULYSSES  MISTAKE    ANTONIA  BY A TENDENCY COMMON TO ALL WEAK SOULS WHO WILLINGLY SOAR BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF NATURE  BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE PROTECTED AND ESPECIALLY TO BE LOVED  IT IS MAYBE FOR THEM THE SAME   ANTONIA ENJOYED BETTER THAN NONE OF THOSE MYSTERIOUS EFFECTS THAT DOUBLE THE ASPECT OF LIFE  AND WHICH GIVE A NEW WORLD TO INTELLIGENCE  SHE DIDN T BELIEVE NOT TO THE EXISTENCE OF THESE INTERMEDIARY BEINGS WHO PLAY A GREAT ROLE IN THE SUPERSTITIONS OF HIS NATIVE LAND AND HIS COUNTRY ADOPTIVE  OF THESE DARK GIANTS WHO REIGN ON THE HIGH MOUNTAINS  WHERE WE SOMETIMES SEE THEM SITTING IN A CLOUD  THEIR ARMS ARMED WITH A HUGE PINE TREE  OF THOSE SYLPHS LIGHTER THAN AIR  WHICH HAVE THEIR PALATE IN THE CHALICE OF A SMALL FLOWER  AND THAT THE ZEPHIR CARRIES OFF IN PASSING  OF THESE NOCTURNAL SPIRITS WHO KEEP THE TREASURES HIDDEN UNDER A ROCK TURNED OVER ON ITS POINT  OR WHICH WANDER AROUND TO WARD OFF THIEVES  LEAVING ON THEIR AN INCONSTANT FLAME THAT RISES  FALLS  GOES OUT REBORN  DISAPPEARS AND IS REBORN AGAIN  BUT SHE LOVED THESE ILLUSIONS  AND MORLAQUE SONG  WHICH SHE HAD OFTEN LISTENED TO WITH PLEASURE  RENEWED THEM ALL AT ONCE  SO SHE LISTENED WITH A LIVELY AND UNADULTERATED INTEREST  WHEN A SINGULAR MOVEMENT OF THE CAR  WHICH SUDDENLY STOPPED  ROCKING ON ITSELF  INTERRUPTED HIS REVERIE  THE HORSES HAD TAKEN A STEP BACK  AND THE MORLAQUE SONG EXPIRED IN THE POSTILION S MOUTH     THE CARS AHEAD OF US HAVE TAKEN THE LEAD    HE SAID    WHILE THE MONK CLIMBED INTO IT  AND THE ROAD IS  IF I DON T DECEIVE ME  CUT OFF BY BRIGANDS      WHAT S HE SAYING    EXCLAIMED MADAME ALBERTI  RUSHING TO DOOR      THAT WE HAVE STOPPED    RESUMED ANTONIA  WHO HAD JUST FALL BACK INTO THE CORNER OF THE CAR  AND SHIVERING TERROR      ARRESTED    REPEATED MADAME ALBERTI AND THE TRAVELERS      ARRESTED  MURDERED  LOST    CONTINUED THE POSTILION    THESE ARE THEY ARE JEAN SBOGAR S TROOP  AND HERE IS THIS EXECRABLE DUINO CASTLE  WHICH WILL BE EVERYONE S TOMB      BY SAINT NICHOLAS OF RAGUSA    SAID THE ARMENIAN MONK  FROM A DEEP AND TERRIBLE ACCENT    THE EARTH WOULD RATHER CRUMBLE UNDER OUR FEET      AND AS HE FINISHED THESE WORDS  HE HAD RUSHED INTO THE MIDST OF ROBBERS  THE FIERCE CRY WHICH HAD FRIGHTENED ANTONIA AT THE FARNEDO WAS HEARD AT THE SAME TIME  AND A THOUSAND HORRIBLE VOICES ROARED IN REPEATING IT  THE DOOR HAD FALLEN BEHIND THE MISSIONARY  THE BLINDS WERE LOWERED  THE HORSES REMAINED MOTIONLESS  A DEAD SILENCE REIGNED IN THE CAR  IT WAS NO LONGER OUTSIDE THAT A MUFFLED NOISE THAT WENT FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY  WHEN  AT THE REDOUBLED WHISTLING OF THE WHIP  THE HORSES SET OFF AGAIN GALLOP  IMPATIENT  AS IF THIS WARNING HAD DESTROYED ON THEM FACTION OF A SPELL  THEY ONLY STOPPED WHEN THEY JOINED OTHER TRAVELERS     AND THE ARMENIAN    CRIED ANTONIA FOR A LONG TIME  HALF LEANING OUT OF THE DOOR    THIS GENEROUS  THIS BRAVE MAN WHO DEVOTED HIMSELF TO US     MY GOD  MY GOD  WOULD WE HAVE IT ABANDONED TO THE ASSASSINS  THAT WOULD BE A HORRIBLE ACTION      HORRIBLE    REPEATED MADAME ALBERTI EAGERLY      DON T WORRY  MY GOOD LADIES    REPLIED THE POSTILION  WHO HAD COME DOWN FROM HIS SEAT  AND HAD RESUMED ALL HIS SECURITY    THIS MONK HAS NOTHING TO FEAR FROM ASSASSINS  THEY DON T CAN DO NOTHING ABOUT HIM  AND  SO THAT YOU KNOW IT  IT IS HE WHO ORDERED ME TO HUNT MY HORSES WHEN I DID  AND THAT RETURNED FOR THAT THE STRENGTH AND THE VOICE  ALSO WITH WHAT IMPETUOSITY THEY SET OFF  HAVE YOU NOTICED  AS FOR HIM  I SAW HIM UP CLOSE  I SWEAR  FOR THE BRIGANDS WERE TOUCHING ME  AND HE GOT THROWN BETWEEN THEM AND ME  SO TERRIBLE  THAT SOME HAVE FALLEN FEAR  AND THAT ALL THE OTHERS FLED  WITHOUT ONLY TURN HIS HEAD  A MINUTE LATER HE WAS ALONE  AND HE WAS THERE  STANDING  HIS HAND RAISED  WITH AN AIR OF COMMAND  GO AWAY  HE SHOUTED AT ME IN SUCH AN IMPOSING VOICE THAT MY BLOOD WAS WOULD BE FROZEN IN MY VEINS IF HE HAD ANNOUNCED ANGER  BUT IT WAS A PROTECTIVE VOICE  THE VOICE HE USUALLY SPEAKS TO THE SAILORS         TO THE SAILORS    SAID MADAME ALBERTI       SO YOU KNOW THIS ARMENIAN      YES  I KNOW IT    REPLIED THE POSTILION    DID HE NOT NAME HIMSELF HIMSELF  WHEN HE CRIED  BY SAINT NICHOLAS OF RAGUSA  WHAT IS THE SAINT WHO TESTS AND REWARDS TRAVELERS  AND WHAT ANOTHER SAINT DISPERSES WITH A WORD  A GESTURE  A LOOK  AN ARMY BANDITS  WHO HAVE SWORDS IN THEIR HANDS  RAGE IN THEIR HEARTS  AND WHO ARE LOOKING FOR DANGER  FOR GOLD AND FOR BLOOD      REQUEST      THE POSTILION WAS SILENT  LOOKING AT THE SKY  WHICH APPEARED TO BE CROSSED BY SUDDEN GLOW  THE CANNON ROARED AT DUINO      VI   SOME CALL HIM THE  GREAT MOGUL   OTHERS THE  PROPHET  ELIE    HE IS AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN WHO CAN BE FOUND EVERYWHERE  WHO IS NOT KNOWN TO ANYONE  AND TO WHOM NO HARM IS MEANT   LEVI S    THIS EXPLANATION WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE  MADAME ALBERTI DESIGNED SEVERAL OTHERS  AND WELCOMED THEM IN TURN  ANTONIA SAW NOTHING DISTINCT IN THIS EVENT  BUT SHE FOUND EVERYTHING IT TOOK TO KEEP DARK IDEAS ALIVE AND DREAMERS  IT WAS IN THIS FRAME OF MIND THAT SHE CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY IN THE MIDST OF THE ENCHANTED COUNTRYSIDE WHICH REMAINED TO BE COVERED  THE NEXT DAY SHE SAW THE LAUGHING GORIZIA  RICH IN FLOWERS AND FRUITS  AND WHOSE APPEARANCE CHARMS FROM AFAR THE EYES OF THE TRAVELER  NEWLY EMERGED FROM THE FRUITLESS SANDS OF ISTRIAN COAST  THE ANCIENT MEMORIES WAKE UP IF NATURALLY ON THIS BELOVED HILLSIDE OF NATURE  OR ARE CONSERVED THERE WITH SUCH EASE  THAT ONE BELIEVES TO LIVE THERE STILL UNDER THE EMPIRE POETICS OF MYTHOLOGY  THE BEAUTIES WALK THERE UNDER CRADLES DEDICATED TO THE GRACES  THE HUNTERS GATHER THERE IN THE DIANE S GROVE  THAT S WHERE THEY COME DOWN TO GO SURPRISE THEIR PREY IN THE FIELDS BORDERING THE ISONZO  ISONZO  THE MOST ELEGANT OF THE RIVERS IN ITALY AND GREECE  WHICH ROLLS  DEEP BETWEEN TWO MOUNTAINS OF A SILVER SAND  ITS BLUE WAVES OF SKY  AS PURE AS THE FIRMAMENT THAT THEY REFLECT  AND THAT THEY DO NOT NEED TO BORROW THE SPARKLE  WHEN IT IS VEILED BY CLOUDS  THE INHABITANT OF GORIZIA REGAINS HIS AZURE ON THE LIMPID SURFACE OF ISONZO  A DAY LATER SHE SPOTTED THE DELICIOUS CANALS OF LA BRENTA  BORDERED BY RICH PALACES  AND THE MODEST VILLAGE OF MESTRE  WHICH SERVES AS A POINT OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PART OF EUROPE AND A CITY TO WHICH EUROPE CAN SHOW NOTHING EQUAL  THIS SUPERB VENICE WHOSE VERY EXISTENCE IS A PHENOMENON  THE DAY WAS BARELY DAWNING  WHEN THE BOAT WHICH WAS TO BE THERE DRIVE MRS  ALBERTI  ANTONIA AND THEIR CAREGIVERS ACCOMPANIED  ENTERED DE LA BRENTA INTO THE SEA  THE LITTLE BUILDING GLIDED GENTLY ON THE STILL WAVE  ALONG THE POLES WHICH DIRECT THE NAUTONIER  MME ALBERTI SAW ON HER RIGHT A WHITE HOUSE  OF A VERY SIMPLE CONSTRUCTION  IN THE MIDDLE OF ISLETS WITH WHICH THIS PART OF THE LAGOONS IS STREWN  HE WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS THE CONVENT OF ARMENIAN CATHOLICS  AND ANTONIA SHUDDERED  UNABLE TO EXPLAIN HIS EMOTION  FINALLY VENICE BEGAN TO EMERGE ON THE HORIZON  LIKE A CUTOUT OF A DARK COLOR  WITH ITS DOMES  BUILDINGS  AND A FOREST OF MASTS OF VESSELS  THEN IT CLEARED UP  EXPANDED  AND OPENED IN FRONT OF THE BOAT  WHICH CIRCULATED FOR A LONG TIME THROUGH BUILDINGS OF ANY SIZE  BEFORE ENTERING THE PARTICULAR CHANNEL ON WHICH WAS LOCATED THE MONTELEONE PALACE  OF WHICH MRS  ALBERTI HAD RECENTLY ACQUIRED  A PAINFUL CIRCUMSTANCE DIFFERED THEIR ARRIVAL  THIS CANAL WAS LOADED WITH GONDOLAS WHICH FOLLOWED A FUNERAL CONVOY  IT WAS THAT OF A YOUNG GIRL  BECAUSE THE GONDOLA WHICH CARRIED THE COFFIN WAS DRAPED IN WHITE  AND STREWN WITH BOUQUETS OF ROSES OF THE SAME COLOR  TWO TORCHES WERE BURNING AT EACH END  AND THEIR LIGHT  ECLIPSED BY THAT OF THE SUN RISING  ONLY SEEMED A BLUISH SMOKE  THERE WAS ONLY ONE ROWER  A PRIEST  STANDING IN THE FRONT OF THE GONDOLA  BUT TURNED ON THE SIDE OF THE BEER  AND A SILVER CROSS IN HIS HANDS  THE PRAYERS OF THE DEAD WHISPERED IN A LOW VOICE  IN FRONT OF HIM  A YOUNG MAN DRESSED IN BLACK  KNEELING AT THE HEAD OF THE COFFIN  WEPT BITTERLY  THE SOUND OF HIS MUFFLED SOBS HAD SOMETHING HEARTBREAKING  IT WAS PROBABLY THE BROTHER OF THE PASSED AWAY  HIS PAIN WAS SO SHARP AND SO DEEPLY FELT THAT  IF SHE HAD BEEN ELATED BY ANOTHER FEELING  SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN DEADLY  A LOVER WOULD NOT HAVE CRIED    THIS ILL OMENED ENCOUNTER EASILY MOVED THE SENSIBILITY FROM ANTONIA  BUT THE FIRST REMARKABLE OBJECT MADE HIM FORGET THE SUPERSTITIOUS THOUGHT SHE HAD SUGGESTED TO HIM  SHE WAS NEAR OF HIS SISTER  WITHOUT REASONABLE GROUNDS FOR FEAR FOR THE FUTURE  SURROUNDED  ON THE CONTRARY  BY ALL THE PROBABILITIES OF A LIFE SWEET  UNALTERABLE TRANQUILITY  SUCH HAPPINESS  FINALLY  IF IT IS FOR TENDER SOULS WHO SYMPATHIZE WITH ALL SUFFERINGS OF SOCIETY  WHICH FEW OF THEM ARE CALLED TO TASTE THE SAME  SHE STOPPED AT THIS PROSPECT  SHE ENJOYS FOR THE FIRST TIME A FEELING OF PURE SECURITY  SHE JUDGED THAT SHE WAS HAPPY  SHE CONCEIVED THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING ALWAYS  AND  INDEED  NEVER HAD IT BEEN MORE SO    THE PEOPLE IN ALL COUNTRIES LOVE THE EXTRAORDINARY  AND SUBJECT TO BEING PASSIONATE ABOUT PEOPLE AND THINGS  BUT NOWHERE DOES IT EXTEND SO FAR AS IN VENICE THE FACULTY OF CREATE GODS  PASSING OBJECTS OF ENTHUSIASM WHOSE RETURNS ARE OFTEN DISASTROUS FOR THOSE WHO EXCITED HIM  HE WAS ONLY A QUESTION  AT THAT TIME  OF A YOUNG FOREIGNER WHO HAD BEEN RECONCILED  WITHOUT KNOWING HOW  BECAUSE HE DID NOT HAD NOT EVEN HINTED AT THE PRETENSION  THIS FAVOR IF BRILLIANT AND SO FLEETING  THE GENIUS  COURAGE AND KINDNESS OF LOTHARIO WAS THE SUBJECT OF ALL THE TALKS  HIS NAME WAS IN ALL MOUTHS  DURING THE SHORT JOURNEY FROM MESTRE TO VENICE  HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT BACK TWENTY TIMES IN THE CONVERSATION OF SAILORS  AFTER WALKING THROUGH HIS NEW HOME  SUPPORTING ANTONIA  TO WHOM THE HABIT OF DELICATE HEALTH RENDERED THE HELP OF HER NECESSARY ARM  EVEN WHEN SHE WAS NOT IN PAIN  MRS  ALBERTI HAD JUST TAKEN HER TO ONE OF THE MAIN ROOMS IN APARTMENT  AND THEY WERE SITTING THERE ONE BESIDE THE OTHER  THE OLD STEWARD INTRODUCED HIMSELF TO GREET THEM  AND REMAINED STANDING WHILE AWAITING THEIR ORDERS     WE ARE HAPPY    SAID MME ALBERTI TO HIM    EVERYTHING RESPONDS TO THIS THAT I EXPECTED FROM YOUR CARE  HONEST MATTEO  AND I CAN JUDGE BY THESE BEGINNINGS THAT NO ONE WILL BE BETTER SERVED IN VENICE    NO  NOT EVEN LORD LOTHARIO   REPLIED THE OLD MAN  HUMILIATING HIS BALD FOREHEAD AND TURNING HIS GOURA IN HIS HANDS OF BLACK SILK    FOR THIS TIME  ANTONIA BURSTING OUT LAUGHING     AND WHAT IS SO  GREAT GOD  LORD LOTHARIO  SINCE WE ARRIVED  I ONLY HEARD HIM NAME      IT IS TRUE    SAID MADAME ALBERTI  RECAPITULATING HER IDEAS WITH ITS ORDINARY HASTE    WHO IS LORD LOTHARIO  TELL US  MY DEAR MATTEO  WHAT TO THINK ABOUT THIS MAN  WHOSE REPUTATION BECAME PROVERBIAL IN VENICE  BEFORE HAVING PAST THE GULF      LADIES    ANSWERED MATTEO    I M NOT MUCH MYSELF MORE EDUCATED  ALTHOUGH I HAVE YIELDED TO USE BY USING THIS NAME THAT HAS SUCH CREDIT IN THIS COUNTRY THAT EVEN THE ROBBERS RESPECT  IT MAY SOUND OVERKILL  BUT THERE IS NOTHING MORE TRUE  AND LORD LOTHARIO INSPIRES SUCH UNIVERSAL RESPECT THAT IT HAS SOMETIMES HAPPENED THAT ONE HAS DROPPED  BY NAMING HIM  THE STYLUS IN THE HANDS OF AN ASSASSIN  THAT NOISE  THE ONLY NOISE OF HIS APPROACH CALMED A REVOLT  DISPELLED A GATHERING OF FURIOUS  RESTORED PEACE TO VENICE  HOWEVER HE IS A YOUNG MAN NOT VERY FORMIDABLE  I ASSURE YOU  BECAUSE WE AGREE IN SAYING THAT HE HAS THE GENTLENESS AND TIMIDITY OF A CHILD IN THE WORLD  I DO NOT I SAW IT ONLY ONCE  AND FROM QUITE A DISTANCE  BUT I EXPERIENCED TO CONTEMPLATE HIS PHYSIOGNOMY A SHOCK THAT MADE ME BELIEVE EVERYTHING THINK OF HIM  SINCE THAT TIME  I HAVE TRIED IN VAIN TO SEE AGAIN  HE HAD LEFT TOWN      HE S NO LONGER IN VENICE    CRIED ANTONIA      HE HAS BEEN ABSENT FOR NEARLY A YEAR AGAINST ITS USE    CONTINUED MATTEO    BECAUSE HE VERY RARELY SPENDS MORE THAN TWO OR THREE MONTHS WITHOUT GOING BACK TO IT      SO HE DOESN T MAKE HIS ORDINARY HOME THERE    SAID MADAM ALBERTI      NO  CERTAINLY    CONTINUED MATTEO    BUT A LONG TIME AGO  FOR A VERY LONG TIME THAT HE COMES FROM MONTH TO MONTH TO SPEND A FEW DAYS  SOMETIMES MORE  SOMETIMES LESS  ALMOST NEVER BEYOND ONE WEEK OR TWO  THIS TIME HIS LONG DISTANCE WOULD HAVE MADE FEAR THAT HE WOULD HAVE ABANDONED VENICE ALTOGETHER  IF THERE WERE NOT NO OTHER EXAMPLES  BUT WE REMEMBER THAT IT HAS ALREADY DISAPPEARED FOR SEVERAL YEARS      SEVERAL YEARS    SAID ANTONIA    YOU DON T THINK SO  MATTEO  YOU TOLD US EARLIER  IF I HEARD YOU CORRECTLY  THAT HE WAS A VERY YOUNG MAN      VERY YOUNG  IN TRUTH    ANSWERED MATTEO       AT LEAST TO THIS THAT IT SEEMS  I DID NOT SAY THE OPPOSITE  BUT I SPEAK ACCORDING TO THE SINGULAR IDEAS OF THE PEOPLE  WHICH DO NOT DESERVE YOUR ATTENTION  MY ILLUSTRIOUS LADIES  AND THAT I WOULD BLUSH MYSELF         GO ON  GO ON  MATTEO    SAID MADAME ALBERTI WITH VEHEMENCE    THIS INTERESTS US A LOT  ISN T IT TRUE  ANTONIA  SIT DOWN  MATTEO  AND FORGET NOTHING  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING REGARDING LOTHARIO      MADAME ALBERTI WAS INDEED KEENLY INTERESTED  AND HER MIND  QUICK TO GRASP ALL ASPECTS OF THINGS  HAD BEEN AHEAD OF MUCH THE NARRATION OF MATTEO IN ROMANTIC CONJECTURES AND WONDERFUL THAT SHE WAS BURNING TO SEE VERIFIED  ANTONIA HAD NOT A LESS LIVELY SENSITIVITY  ON THE CONTRARY  SHE WAS MORE IRRITABLE AND GREEDY FOR EMOTIONS  BUT SHE DREADED THEM  BECAUSE THAT HIS WEAKNESS ALWAYS EXPOSED HIM TO YIELD TO IT  WHEN MATTEO HAD BEGAN TO EXCITE MADAME ALBERTI S CURIOSITY BY THE VAGUE AND BIZARRE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER STORY  SHE HAD PRESSED AGAINST HER SISTER WITH A SHIVER OF WORRY AND DREAD WHOSE IMPRESSION SHE TRIED TO COVER WITH A SMILE     WHAT I KNOW OF LORD LOTHARIO    REPLIED MATTEO GRAVELY   WHO SAT DOWN TO OBEY MADAME ALBERTI    IS NOT KNOWN TO ME  AS I TOLD YOU  MY ILLUSTRIOUS LADIES  ONLY BY NOISE PUBLIC  HE IS A YOUNG MAN OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FIGURE  WHO APPEARS FROM TIME TO TIME IN VENICE WITH A PRINCE S TRAIN  AND WHO YET SEEMS TO HAVE LOOKED FOR A HOME IN A BIG CITY THAN TO FIND THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPREAD MORE LIBERALITIES ABUNDANT AMONG THE POOR  BECAUSE THEY DO NOT FREQUENT SOCIETY MUCH  AND WE HARDLY KNEW HIM ANY HABITS AND FRIENDSHIPS FAMILIAR NEITHER IN MEN NOR IN WOMEN  HE SOMETIMES VISITS A UNHAPPY FAMILY TO HELP HIM  PASSIONATE ABOUT ARTS  WHICH HE CULTIVATES WITH SUCCESS  HE SOMETIMES SEEKS CONVERSATION AND ADVICE FROM THOSE WHO EXERCISE THEM  OUT OF THESE REPORTS  WHICH HE LIMITS WITH EXTRAORDINARY CARE  HE SAW ALMOST LONELY IN VENICE  HE DID NOT ENTER TEN TIMES IN A PRIVATE HOUSE  HE DOES NOT CORRESPOND WITH ANYONE  THAT IS TO THE POINT THAT NEVER BEFORE HAS A MAN BEEN ENOUGH IN HIS PRIVACY TO KNOW THE NAME OF HIS FAMILY  OR TO KNOW THE PLACE OF HIS BIRTH  OR TO FORM A CONJECTURE BASED ON THE MYSTERY OF HIS LIFE  IT IS TRUE THAT HE HAS A LOT OF SERVANTS  BUT ALL OF THEM ARE FOREIGNERS  BECAUSE HE CHANGES THEM EVERY TIME HE TRAVELS  AND THAT HE PROCURES IN VENICE EVEN THOSE WHO ARE TO SERVE HIM DURING THAT HE RESIDES THERE  HIS RELATIONSHIPS OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE DO NOT GIVE MORE LIGHTS  SINCE WE KNOW HIM  THE POST HAS NEVER BROUGHT A LETTER  THE BANKERS DID NOT PROVIDE HIM WITH A SEQUIN  STATE REVOLUTIONS DON T CHANGE A THING TO ITS POSITION  IN STORMY WEATHER HE DOES NOT WANDER AWAY THAN USUAL  AND WHEN TRAVELERS ARE SUBJECT TO PRECAUTIONARY FORMALITIES  HIS PAPERS ARE ALWAYS SIGNED OF THE GOVERNING AUTHORITY  UNDER THE SIMPLE NAME OF LOTHARIO  THAT A SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD MAKE IT SUSPECT  IF ONE DID NOT KNOW THAT THIS HOST OF GOOD DEEDS ATTACHED TO IT RECOMMENDED HIM TO POWERFUL MEN OF ALL AGES AND ALL PARTIES     IT WOULD ALSO BE DIFFICULT TO WORRY HIM IN VENICE  WHERE HE IS  FOR A HUGE CLASS  AN OBJECT OF RECOGNITION  AFFECTION  AND  SO TO SPEAK  WORSHIP  THE PROSCRIPTION OF LOTHARIO  IF EVER HE HAD GIVEN CAUSE TO THINK ABOUT IT  WOULD BE PERHAPS THE SIGNAL FOR A REVOLUTION  BUT HE DOESN T SEEM TO BELIEVE  BECAUSE IT FORCES THE UNHAPPY CLASS WITHOUT CARESSING IT  HIS SEVERE SPIRIT AND A LITTLE HAUGHTY  IT IS ASSURED  SEPARATES HIM OF HER BY AN OBSTACLE WHICH HE ALONE CAN REMOVE  AND WHICH HE WOULD NOT RISE WITHOUT UPSETTING THE VENETIAN STATES  IF HE HAD RESOLVED  THIS STRONG DISTANCE THAT HE LEFT BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE PEOPLE DO NOT REVOLT ANYONE  BECAUSE WE FEEL THAT NATURE ITSELF MARKED THE LIMITS  AND THAT IT SEPARATES IT MOREOVER MUCH MORE NOTICEABLY MEN WHO SEEM TO APPROACH HER CONDITION  INDEED  THESE ARE THE ONES FOR WHICH HE SHOWS THE MORE DISTANCE  AND IF WE SEE LORD LOTHARIO COMING DOWN IN FAVOR OF SOMEONE OF THE HEIGHTS OF HIS CHARACTER  IT IS NEVER FOR A LORD  IT S FOR A CRIPPLE WHO NEEDS HIS SUPPORT  FOR A LOST CHILD  FOR AN EPILEPTIC WHOSE SIGHT REPELS PASSERS BY  THIS DOES NOT PREVENT HIM FROM ATTENDING PUBLIC MEETINGS AND LARGE CORPORATIONS WHERE MEN CAN LOOK AND EVEN SHINE WITHOUT IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATING WITH NOBODY  HE WAS EASILY NOTICED THERE  SINCE VENICE HAS NO ARTIST AND VIRTUOSO WHO IS SAID TO BE COMPARABLE TO HIM  BUT FAR FROM USING THESE ADVANTAGES  IT IS CLAIMED THAT HE IS AFRAID OF THEM  TO ARGUE  THAT HE ONLY LETS THEM SEE WITH REGRET  AND THAT THIS IS WHEN THEY COULD PROVIDE HIM WITH KNOWLEDGE PLEASANT  OR LARGE ESTABLISHMENTS  THAT HE FLED FROM VENICE  AS IF TO AVOID THE GLARE OF A PUBLIC AND WIDESPREAD LIFE  WHICH WOULD STEAL FROM HIMSELF AND THE SECRET HE WANTS TO ENVELOP HIMSELF IN  AMBITION CAN DO NOTHING ON HIM  EVEN LOVE NEVER HAS IT ARRESTED  ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NO MORE WOMEN ON EARTH ATTRACTIVE THAN IN VENICE  ONLY ONCE DID HE SEEM TO BE BUSY A LOT OF A NOBLE GIRL  WHO  ON HER SIDE  HAD TESTIFIED A STRONG PASSION FOR HIM  BUT A VERY EXTRAORDINARY MISFORTUNE END TO THE RELATIONS THAT THE PUBLIC SUPPOSED BETWEEN THEM  IT WAS AT WHEN LOTHARIO LEFT  WHO THIS TIME HAD RESIDED IN VENICE A LITTLE MORE THAN USUAL  AND THAT THIS FEELING  IF IT HAS EXISTED  COULD NOT HOWEVER HOLD BACK  TWO OR THREE DAYS BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE  SHE DISAPPEARED  AND HER BODY WAS ONLY FOUND FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARDS  AGAINST THIS SANDBANK WHERE HE HAS SETTLED SINCE CONVENT OF THE ARMENIANS     THAT IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE    SAID ANTONIA WITH AN AIR  DEEPLY FOCUSED      NO  MADEMOISELLE    REPLIED MATTEO  FOLLOWING HIS THOUGHT  MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN THE SAME AS ANTONIA S    MOVEMENT OF WATER DISCHARGED BY THE SEA CARRIES ON THIS SIDE MOST OF THE DEBRIS FLOATING IN OUR CANALS  AS THIS LADY HAD THE HEAD LONG LIVE  AND THAT SOME PECULIARITIES THAT I HAVE FORGOTTEN ANNOUNCED THAT HIS DEATH HAD BEEN VIOLENT  IT WAS ATTRIBUTED TO DESPAIR RATHER THAN TO AN ACCIDENT  I EVEN BELIEVE THAT A LETTER FROM HIS HAND  WHICH WAS FOUND AFTERWARDS  AND IN WHICH SHE EXPLAINED HER DESIGN  JUSTIFIED THIS SUPPOSITION      TAKE CARE  MATTEO    SAID MADAME ALBERTI    YOU STARTED BY TELLING US THAT LOTHARIO WAS YOUNG     TWENTY FIVE OR TWENTY SIX AT THE MOST   REPLIED MATTEO    BUT HE IS VERY FAIR AND DELICATE TO SEE HIM  ALTHOUGH MORE SKILFUL AND MORE ROBUST THAN THE MOST HEAVILY CONSTITUTED MEN  AND IT COULD BE POSSIBLE        IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE    SHE CONTINUED FORCEFULLY    THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABSENT FOR SEVERAL YEARS SINCE HE WAS TO KNOW IN VENICE  THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE NOT CLARIFIED  REMEMBER  MOREOVER  THAT THE STORY OF THE YOUNG GIRL FOUND DEAD IN THE ISLAND OF THE ARMENIANS MUST BE PRIOR  ON YOUR TERMS  TO WHEN THE ARMENIANS CAME TO SETTLE THERE  AND THEN         I DON T KNOW ANY MORE    REPLIED MATTEO WITH A SORT OF CONFUSION    AND I ONLY TOLD THESE LADIES WHAT I HEARD TELL THE VENETIANS  OF AN ADVANCED AGE  WHO CLAIM THAT THEY HAVE SEEN ONCE LORD LOTH ARIO AS HE IS TODAY  BUT WHO SUPPOSE HE HAS NOT BEEN ABSENT FOR LESS THAN FIFTY YEARS  AND YOU FEEL THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF THIS IDEA  BESIDES  IT IS TOO NATURAL TO BELIEVE  FROM LORD LOTHARIO S WAY OF LIFE  THAT HE A GREAT INTEREST IN HIDING WHAT IT REALLY IS  SO AS NOT TO UNDERSTAND THE CARE THAT HE UNDOUBTEDLY TOOK TO PROMOTE AND EVEN TO CREATE THE RUMORS THAT WERE TO REDOUBLE ON HIS ACCOUNT THE UNCERTAINTY OF OPINION  SO WE MUST ADMIT THAT THERE IS NO NOT SO STRANGE AND SO RIDICULOUS THAT THEY HAVE NOT HAD AT LEAST THE CREDIT OF BEING REPEATED  FOR SOME TIME  BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE A REPUTATION FOR BEING SANE  YOU WILL JUDGE BY MOST LIKELY OF ALL  IT IS THAT THIS MYSTERIOUS STRANGER HAS THE SECRET OF THE PHILOSOPHER S STONE  AND  INDEED  WE DO NOT SEE HOW ELSE TO EXPLAIN THE MAGNIFICENT EXISTENCE AND THE KING S EXPENSES OF A STRANGER TO WHOM ONE DOES NOT KNOW THE LESSER KIND OF COMMERCE OR INDUSTRY  THE SMALLEST PROPERTY  THE LIGHTEST BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP OF ANY KIND WHETHER IT BE  ALMOST THREE YEARS AGO  IT WAS THE TIME OF HIS FIRST TRIP  SINCE THE LONG ABSENCE OF WHICH THESE PEOPLE SPEAK  HERE  ONLY JEALOUS PEOPLE  IRRITATED BY ITS PRODIGIOUS SUCCESSES  AND ALL THE MORE PERHAPS THAT HE ATTACHED LESS IMPORTANCE TO IT HIMSELF  AND THAT THE MOST ORDINARY MARK OF ATTENTION YOU CAN GET OF HIM SINGULARLY RESEMBLES DISDAIN  DECIDED TO DO TO RUN OVER HIM THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS FABLE  I HARDLY DARE REPEAT  AND I WOULDN T DO IT SAFELY ANYWHERE BUT HERE  WE WENT SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT HE WAS THE AGENT OF A TROOP OF COUNTERFEITERS HIDDEN IN THE CAVES OF TYROL  OR IN SOME CROATIA FOREST  THIS ERROR DID NOT LAST LONG  AS THE LORD LOTHARIO SPREADS THE GOLD SO PROFUSELY  THAT IT IS EASY TO VERIFY THE TITLE AND MANUFACTURE  WE CONVINCED OURSELVES WELL THAT THERE WAS NO BETTER IN ALL THE STATES OF VENICE  AND  SINCE THAT MOMENT  IF WE INVENTED FABLES ABOUT HIS HOWEVER  AT LEAST THEY CEASED TO BE ABUSIVE AND ATROCIOUS  THIS THAT HE REALLY IS  THAT S WHAT I DON T KNOW    SAID MATTEO WHEN GETTING UP FROM HIS SEAT    BUT I CAN REPEAT THAT IT DEPENDS ON ALMOST HIM TO BE WHATEVER HE WANTS TO BE IN VENICE  IF THERE COME BACK      HE WILL COME BACK TO IT   SAID MADAME ALBERTI  EMBRACING THIS IDEA  WITH THAT ROMANTIC SUSCEPTIBILITY THAT SHE TOOK TOO OFTEN FOR PENETRATION  IT WAS HIS ONLY FLAW      VII   YOU WILL SEE ME AGAIN IN THIS FORM  AND THAT DAY WILL BE THE LAST   SHAKESPEARE    THIS CONVERSATION HAD NOT LEFT VERY DEEP TRACES IN ANTONIA S MIND  AS LOTHARIO S NAME OFTEN CAME UP IN THE CIRCLES WHERE HIS SISTER HAD INTRODUCED HER  HE NEVER HIT HARDLY HIS EARS WITHOUT REMINDING HIM VAGUELY OF THE BIZARRE IDEAS AND SINGULAR WHICH MATTEO HAD ENTERTAINED THEM  BUT IT WAS NOT THAN A PASSING SENSATION  TO WHICH SHE WOULD HAVE BLUSHED TO DELIVER  BY TRYING TO REALIZE AT THE FIRST MOMENT OF THE IMPRESSION THAT THIS STORY HAD GIVEN HER  SHE GRIEVED AT NOT TO BE ABLE TO FIX A CERTAIN JUDGMENT ON LOTHARIO  BUT HE WAS NOT IN HIS CHARACTER TO STRAY FOR A LONG TIME IN CONJECTURES USELESS ON THINGS THAT TOUCHED HER SO LIGHTLY  THE WEAKNESS OF HIS CONSTITUTION  THE USUAL DEPRESSION OF HIS ORGANS  FORCED HER TO LIMIT HER FEELINGS A GREAT DEAL  AND THE MORE POWERFUL THEY WERE AROUND HER  THE LESS CAPABLE SHE WAS TO EXTEND THEM TO UNKNOWN OBJECTS  ONE DAY  HOWEVER  THE NOISE RAN INTO VENICE THAT LOTHARIO HAD ARRIVED  AND THIS NOISE  SOON CONFIRMED BY THE MAD JOY OF AN ENTHUSIASTIC POPULACE  QUICKLY TO ANTONIA  THAT VERY DAY SHE WAS TO BE FOUND  WITH MRS  ALBERTI  IN A COMPANY MADE UP LARGELY OF FOREIGN LORDS  ATTRACTED TO VENICE BY THE PLEASURES OF CARNIVAL  AND WHO MET FROM TIME TO TIME TO THE MUSIC  NO SOONER HAD THEY ENTERED THAN A LACKEY ANNOUNCED THE LORD LOTHARIO    A SUDDEN SHUDDER OF ASTONISHMENT AND PLEASURE RAN THROUGH ASSEMBLY  AND ESPECIALLY SEIZED UPON MADAME ALBERTI  THAT ALL EXTRAORDINARY IDEAS EASILY WORRIED  SHE TOOK THIS MOVEMENT FOR A HAPPY PRESENTIMENT  AND LIKE ALL ITS THOUGHTS WERE RELATED TO ANTONIA  SHE SUDDENLY SQUEEZED HIS HAND  WITHOUT KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT THIS DEMONSTRATION COULD MEAN  ANTONIA WAS AFFECTED OTHERWISE  HER HEART SANK WITH A KIND OF DREAD  BECAUSE SHE GATHERED AROUND THE NAME LOTHARIO SOME OF THOSE DISTURBING AND TERRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAD STRUCK HER IN THE SPEECH OF THE OLD STEWARD  SHE DELAYED EVEN FOR A WHILE LOOKING UP AT HIM  BUT SHE SAW HIM THEN DISTINCTLY  BECAUSE HE WAS NOT FAR FROM HER  AND HE SEEMED TO BE LOOKING AT HER WHEN HE SAW HER  AT THE SAME TIME HE HAD DIVERTED HIS SIGHT  WITHOUT FIXING IT HOWEVER ON ANY OTHER OBJECT  LEANING ON THE RIM OF AN ANTIQUE MARBLE VASE LOADED WITH FLOWERS  HE SEEMED TO TAKE PART IN A LITTLE TALK IMPORTANCE  TO DISPENSE WITH PAYING ATTENTION ELSEWHERE  ANTONIA WAS SEIZED AT HIS APPEARANCE WITH AN EMOTION SHE HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED  AND WHICH DID NOT RESEMBLE A KNOWN FEELING  IT WAS NO LONGER FEAR  IT WASN T THE IDEA EITHER THAT SHE WAS HAVING THE FIRST TROUBLES OF LOVE  IT WAS SOMETHING VAGUE  INDECISIVE  OBSCURE  WHICH REMINISCENCE OF A DREAM OR A FIT OF FEVER  HER BREAST THROBBED VIOLENTLY  HIS LIMBS LOST THEIR FLEXIBILITY  HIS EYES WERE TROUBLED  AN INDEFINABLE LANGUOR CHAINED ITS FASCINATED ORGANS  SHE TRIED IN VAIN TO BREAK THIS PRESTIGE  HE INCREASED HIS EFFORTS  SHE HAD HEARD OF THE INVINCIBLE NUMBNESS OF THE LOST TRAVELER THAT THE BOA ICE A LOOK INTO THE FORESTS OF AMERICA  DIZZINESS THAT SURPRISES A SHEPHERD WHO CAME AFTER HIS GOATS TO THE END ONE OF THE GIGANTIC PEAKS OF THE ALPS  AND WHICH  DAZZLED STROKE BY THE CIRCULAR MOVEMENT THAT HIS IMAGINATION LENDS  AS A MAGIC MIRROR  TO THE ABYSSES BY WHICH IT IS SURROUNDED  RUSHES FROM ITSELF IN THEIR HORRIFIC DEPTHS  UNABLE TO RESIST THIS POWER WHICH REVOLTS HIM AND WHICH CARRIES HIM ALONG  SHE FELT SOMETHING SIMILAR AND SO DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN  I DON T KNOW WHAT TENDER AND ODIOUS  WHICH ASTONISHED  WHICH REPELLED  WHICH CALLED  WHICH OVERWHELMED HIS HEART  SHE TREMBLED  THIS TREMOR THAT WAS QUITE ORDINARY TO HIM DID NOT FRIGHTEN MADAME ALBERTI  SHE HOWEVER URGED ANTONIA TO COME OUT  AND ANTONIA WANTED HIM  SHE MADE AN EFFORT TO GET UP  FAINTED  SAT DOWN AND SMILED AT MADAME ALBERTI  WHO REGARDED THAT SMILE AS A CONSENT TO STAY  LOTHARIO HAD NOT CHANGED PLACES    HE WAS DRESSED IN THE FRENCH STYLE WITH ELEGANT SIMPLICITY  NOTHING DID NOT ANNOUNCE THE SLIGHTEST RESEARCH IN HIS COSTUME AND IN HIS ADORNMENT  IF NOT TWO SMALL EMERALDS THAT HUNG FROM HIS EARS  AND WHO  UNDER THE THICK CURLS OF BLOND HAIR WHOSE HIS FACE WAS SHADED GAVE HIM A SINGULAR APPEARANCE AND WILD  THIS ORNAMENT HAD LONG CEASED TO BE IN THE FASHION IN THE VENETIAN STATES  AS IN ALMOST ALL OF EUROPE CIVILIZED  LOTHARIO WAS NOT REGULARLY HANDSOME  BUT HIS FIGURE HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY CHARM  HER BIG MOUTH  HER LIPS NARROW AND PALE  SHOWING WHITE TEETH DAZZLING  DISDAINFUL AND SOMETIMES FIERCE HABIT OF HER PHYSIOGNOMY  REPELLED AT FIRST GLANCE  BUT HIS EYE FULL OF TENDERNESS AND POWER  STRENGTH AND GOODNESS  IMPOSED THE RESPECT AND LOVE  ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU SAW ONE A CERTAIN SOFT LIGHT  WHICH EMBELLISHED ALL HER FEATURES  HIS VERY HIGH AND VERY PURE FOREHEAD  ALSO HAD SOMETHING STRANGE  A STRONGLY WAVY FOLD  WHICH AGE HAD NOT PRODUCED  AND WHICH MARKED THE TRACE OF A WORRIED AND FREQUENT THOUGHT  HER PHYSIOGNOMY WAS GENERALLY SERIOUS AND GLOOMY  BUT NO ONE IT WAS NO LONGER EASY TO ERASE AN UNPLEASANT PREVENTION  HE IT WAS ENOUGH FOR HIM TO LIFT HIS EYELID  AND LEAVE SOME DESCEND THAT HEAVENLY FIRE WITH WHICH HIS EYES WERE ANIMATED  FOR THE OBSERVERS  THERE WAS SOMETHING UNSPEAKABLE IN THAT LOOK  WHICH BELONGED TO AN ORGANIZATION SUPERIOR TO THAT OF MAN  FOR THE VULGAR  HE WAS  DEPENDING ON THE OCCASION  EITHER CARESSING OR IMPERIOUS  YOU COULD TELL HE COULD BE TERRIBLE    ANTONIA HAD A CERTAIN STRENGTH ON THE PIANO  BUT HIS SHYNESS ALMOST ALWAYS PREVENTED HIM FROM DEVELOPING HIS KNOWLEDGE IN FRONT OF A LARGE SOCIETY  THERE IS A KIND OF MODESTY  AND THAT WAS THE HIS OWN  WHICH CONSISTS IN CONTINUALLY CONCEALING HIS FACULTIES DO NOT HURT MEDIOCRE PEOPLE  WHO ARE MOSTLY FOUND EVERYWHERE  AND PERHAPS ALSO SO AS NOT TO DISPLEASE THE MINORITY WHO JUDGE  BY AN APPEARANCE OF PRETENSION  SHE NEVER HAD CONSENTED TO PERFORM A PIECE OF MUSIC IN PUBLIC ONLY BY CONDESCENSION FOR INVITATIONS SHE ATTRIBUTED TO A SIMPLE POLITENESS  AND TO WHICH SHE WAS OF COURSE SATISFY  WITHOUT BEING INTERESTED IN THIS WEAK EFFORT OF DECORUM RECIPROCATED ALL THE RESOURCES OF HER TALENT  SHE EVEN HAD NOTICED THAT THE TESTIMONIALS OF OBLIGATORY SATISFACTION THAT RECEIVED HER COMPLACENCY WERE NOT LESS WHEN SHE HAD MADE A PASSAGE SIMPLY AND FOLLOWING THE ONLY RULES OF MECHANICAL EXECUTION  THAT WHEN IT WAS DIRECTED BY A SUDDEN AND HAPPY INSPIRATION  WHICH SATISFIED HER INTERNALLY  SO SHE SAT DOWN AT THE PIANO CALMLY ENOUGH  WHEN SHE WAS CALLED  AND SHE LET HER FINGERS RUN OVER THE KEYBOARD WITH ITS USUAL INDIFFERENCE  WHEN ITS EYES  DISTRACTED BY THE REFLECTION OF A MIRROR IN FRONT OF WHICH SHE WAS PLACED  WERE STRUCK BY A STRANGE AND TERRIBLE ILLUSION  LOTHARIO HAD APPROACHED HIS SEAT  AND AS THAT SEAT WAS MOUNTED ON THE PLATFORM WHERE THE INSTRUMENT WAS PLACED  HIS HEAD PALE AND MOTIONLESS ROSE ALONE ABOVE ANTONIA S RED CASHMERE  THE MESSY HAIR OF THIS MYSTERIOUS YOUNG MAN  THE FIXITY GLOOMY WITH ITS SAD AND SEVERE EYE  THE PAINFUL CONTEMPLATION WHICH HE SEEMED IMMERSED  THE CONVULSIVE MOVEMENT OF THIS FOLD BIZARRE AND TORTUOUS THAT MISFORTUNE NO DOUBT HAD ENGRAVED ON ITS FOREHEAD  EVERYTHING COMBINED TO GIVE THIS ASPECT SOMETHING SCARY  ANTONIA  SURPRISED  BANNED  FRIGHTENED  POSTPONED SUCCESSIVELY HIS GAZES FROM THE DESK TO THE MIRROR AND FROM THE MIRROR TO THE DESK  SOON LOST SIGHT OF THE CONFUSED NOTES AND UNTIL THE AUDIENCE THAT SURROUNDED HIM  UNINTENTIONALLY SUBSTITUTING THE FEELING THAT GRIPPED HER TO THE ONE SHE HAD TO PAINT  SHE IMPROVISED BY AN EXTRAORDINARY TRANSITION  BUT WHICH HAD TO PASS FOR A SINGULAR PLAY OF HIS IMAGINATION RATHER THAN FOR THIS THAT SHE REALLY WAS  AN EXPRESSION OF TERROR SO TRUE THAT EVERYONE SHUDDERED  SHE THREW HERSELF INTO MADAME ALBERTI S ARMS WHO BROUGHT HER BACK TO HER PLACE IN THE MIDST OF A RUMOR APPLAUSE  MIXED WITH SURPRISE AND CONCERN  AFTER TO HAVE FOLLOWED IT WITH MY EYE TO THE PLACE WHERE IT STOPPED  LOTHARIO APPROACHED A HARP  AND A UNIVERSAL MOVEMENT OF CURIOSITY AND PLEASURE SUCCEEDED THE ONE WHO HAD JUST DISTURBED A ASSEMBLY TIME  ANTONIA HERSELF  REASSURED AND DISTRACTED BY A NEW IMPRESSION  EXPRESSED THE KEENEST IMPATIENCE TO HEAR LOTHARIO  AND AS HE SEEMED TO FEAR THAT HIS CONDITION WOULD NOT HAVE BECOME QUIET ENOUGH FOR HER TO TAKE PART FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING S PLEASURES  SHE FELT OBLIGED TO HIM TESTIFY BY A LOOK THAT HIS INDISPOSITION HAD CEASED  THIS LOTHARIO S MARK OF INTEREST HAD TOUCHED HER DEEPLY  HOUSE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT LOTHARIO  MORE SENSITIVE STILL LIGHTLY DEMONSTRATION HE HAD JUST RECEIVED  HAD CHANGED HIS EXISTENCE WHILE ANTONIA WATCHED HIM  HIS FOREHEAD HAD CLEARED  HIS EYES SHONE WITH A STRANGE LIGHT  A SMILE WHERE WAS DONE NOTICE A REMNANT OF TENDERNESS AND A BEGINNING OF JOY EMBELLISHED HER SEVERE MOUTH  PASSING HIS LEFT HAND THROUGH THE WIDE WAVES OF HER HAIR TO LOOK FOR A PATTERN OR A MEMORY  AND SEIZING THE OTHER WITH LIGHTNESS THE STRINGS OF HARP  SO AS TO GIVE IT ONLY A VAGUE VIBRATION  IT ENTAILED BY PRELUDING THOSE FLEETING BUT ENCHANTED SOUNDS  WHICH HOLD THE CONCERT OF MINDS  AND HE SEEMED TO THROW THEM WITHOUT EFFORT AND ABANDON THEM TO THE AIR     WOE TO YOU    HE WHISPERED    WOE TO YOU  IF YOU EVER GREW IN THE FORESTS WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO THE DOMINATION OF JEAN SBOGAR       IT IS    HE CONTINUED    THE FAMOUS ROMANCE OF THE ANEMONE  IF KNOWN TO ZARA  AND THE NEWEST PRODUCTION OF POETRY MORLAQUE      ANTONIA  DEEPLY MOVED BY THE CHOICE OF THIS TUNE AND BY THE SOUND OF THE LOTHARIO S VOICE  APPROACHED MADAME ALBERTI  WHO WAS VERY CONCERNED ON HER SIDE  SHE ALSO REMEMBERED THAT VOICE HARMONIOUS AND THE PLACE WHERE SHE HEARD IT  BUT IT COULD BE THE EFFECT OF A FORTUITOUS RESEMBLANCE  DALMATIAN SONG IS TOO SIMPLE  TOO UNIFORM  TOO STRIPPED OF ORNAMENTATION  FOR NOT BE EASY TO MISTAKE BETWEEN TWO SIMILAR VOICES  FINALLY  AFTER A MOMENT OF REFLECTION  LOTHARIO RESUMED HIS ROMANCE WHILE WHOLE  BY CONTINUING TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY THESE AIR AGREEMENTS THAT THE HARP RETURNED UNDER HIS FINGERS  AND WHOSE RELIGIOUS MELODY MARRIED WITH HIS SONG IN THE MOST IMPOSING MANNER  REACHED THE REFRAIN OF OLD MORLAQUE  HE EMPHASIZED IT WITH SUCH PITY PAINFUL THAT ALL HEARTS WERE TOUCHED  BUT ABOVE ALL THAT OF ANTONIA  WHO ATTACHED A MEMORY TO THIS IDEA OF WORRY AND DREAD  LOTHARIO S ROMANCE WAS OVER FOR A LONG TIME  THAT HIS LAST WORDS AND THE DREADED NAME OF JEAN SBOGAR STILL ECHOED IN HIS THOUGHTS      VIII   DREAM  INNOCENT CREATURES  AND REST IN THE SWEET SLEEP THAT KEEPS YOUR SENSES DOZING  YOU WILL SOON HAVE  ALAS  SAD VIGILS AND CRUEL INSOMNIA   MILTON    AMONG THE ASSUMPTIONS WHICH SUCCEEDED IN THE MIND OF MRS  ALBERTI FOLLOWING THIS EVENING  THERE WAS ONE THAT OFFERED ENOUGH VERISIMILITUDE TO STRIKE VULGAR IMAGINATIONS  AND WHICH DID NOT HOWEVER LACK THIS ROMANTIC ASPECT THAT USUALLY SEARCHED IN HIS COMBINATIONS  THE REST OF HIS CONJECTURE WAS SO ILL FOUNDED THAT IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE SHE STUCK TO THIS ONE  WHICH SUITED HIM ALL THE BETTER AS IT FLATTERED THE MOST PLEASANT AND DOMINANT OF HIS FEELINGS  HIS LOVE FOR ANTONIA  THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS BELOVED SISTER OCCUPIED HER WITHOUT CEASE  SHE WAS DETERMINED NOT TO NEGLECT ANYTHING SO THAT HE WOULD ENSURE HIS HAPPINESS  AND TO SUBORDINATE TO THIS SOLE INTEREST ALL THE OTHERS CONVENIENCES  THE IMMENSE LEGACY OF ANTONIA  THE ONE THAT MRS  ALBERTI HAD TO LEAVE HIM A DAY  WERE MADE TO EXCITE GREED CROWD OF SUITORS  AND MRS  ALBERTI DID NOT WANT THE HER SISTER S LIFE DEPENDED ON THE VILE MAN WHOSE LOVE WOULD BE ONE SPECULATION AND THE ALLIANCE A MARKET  IT WAS ACCORDING TO THE FEELINGS THAT SHE PROMISED HERSELF TO SEE HATCH IN HER THAT SHE HAD RESOLVED TO DISPOSE OF HIS HAND  ALMOST SURE THAT THE HEART OF ANTONIA  LED BY THE JUDGMENT AND EXPERIENCE OF A SECOND MOTHER  COULD NOT BE WRONG  ALREADY SEVERAL YOUNG PEOPLE OF A GREAT FORTUNE OR A DISTINGUISHED BIRTH HAD SET NEEDLESSLY IN THE RANKS  NONE OF THEM HAD MANAGED TO FIX THE ATTENTION OF HER SISTER  AND MME ALBERTI  ATTENTIVE TO SLIGHTEST SENSATIONS OF THIS NAIVE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD SOUL  DO NOT HAD NEVER CAUGHT A SECRET  THE FIRST ASPECT OF LOTHARIO SEEMED  ON THE CONTRARY  TO HAVE MADE AN IMPRESSION ON HER PROFOUND  WHICH ALONE COULD EXPLAIN THE SINGULAR SCENE OF THE PIANO  LOTHARIO HIMSELF HAD NOT SEEMED LESS MOVED  LESS TROUBLED  LESS PENETRATED BY A POWERFUL AFFECTION  AND THE IDEA THAT SUCH A MAN  SO RENOWNED FOR THE BRILLIANCE OF HIS MIND  FOR THE VARIETY OF HIS TALENTS  BY THE TENDERNESS AND GENEROSITY OF HIS CHARACTER  BY THE GRANDEUR OF HIS MANNERS AND THE PURITY OF HIS MANNERS  COULD BECOME ANTONIA S HUSBAND  WAS FOR MRS  ALBERTI THE MOST SWEET ILLUSIONS  WHAT WAS THIS LOTHARIO  HOWEVER  AND HOW TO BOND SUCH SERIOUS RELATIONSHIPS WITH A STRANGER WHO PERSISTED  BY EVERYONE S ADMISSION  TO SURROUND HIMSELF WITH THE MYSTERY THE MOST SUSPECT  THIS PROBLEM WORRIED ONLY A MOMENT MADAM ALBERTI  IN A SHORT TIME SHE HAD FOUND EXPLANATIONS FOR EVERYTHING  AND SHE HAD THE ART OR THE HAPPINESS OF RELATING THEM ALL TO HER FIRST THOUGHT  WITH ENOUGH SEMBLANCE OF TRUTH THAT ANTONIA EVEN  WHO DID NOT ALWAYS SEE THINGS WITH THE SAME EYES  REMAINED WITHOUT OBJECTION AND WITHOUT ANSWER  IT IS TRUE THAT HIS HEART BEGAN TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN THIS HYPOTHESIS AND WISH IT WAS THE REALITY  NOT THAT SHE FELT FOR LOTHARIO THIS MOVEMENT OF GENTLE SYMPATHY WHICH INDICATES THE NEED TO LOVE  THIS ATTRACTION INDEFINABLE THAT MAKES YOU CEASE TO BE YOURSELF TO LIVE ON THE EXISTENCE OF ANOTHER  WHAT SHE WAS EXPERIENCING DID NOT YET HAVE THIS CHARACTER  IT WAS RATHER THE TRAINING OF A SUBMISSIVE SOUL  THE RESIGNATION FROM THE WEAKNESS THAT ASKS ONLY TO BE PROTECTED  THE VOLUNTARY DEPENDENCE OF A TIMID AND SENSITIVE CREATURE ON ONE THAT IMPOSES TRUST AND RESPECT ON HIM  SUCH HAD HIM APPEARED LOTHARIO  AND THE FIRST GLANCE OF THIS YOUNG MAN WAS ARRESTED OVER HER WITH SO MUCH EMPIRE  THAT IT SEEMED TO HER THAT FROM THAT MOMENT HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN RIGHTS OVER HIS DESTINY    I HAVE NOT SAID SO FAR WHAT MRS  ALBERTI  SHE THOUGHT  QUITE RIGHTLY  THAT BY SUBTRACTING FROM THE STORY OF LOTHARIO WHAT POPULAR RUMORS HAD THERE ADDED RIDICULOUS AND ABSURD  IT REMAINED PROBABLE THAT HIS CONDITION AND HIS FORTUNE WERE ALL THAT HIS EDUCATION AND ITS MAGNIFICENCE  THAT IF HE HAD REASONS FOR HIDE HIS NAME AND RANK  THEY COULD ONLY BE MOMENTARY  THAT THIS DISGUISE WAS NOT ALARMING FOR THE LOVE OF ANTONIA WHICH WAS NOT BELOW ANY ALLIANCE  THAT THE DESIRE TO GRAB HER ATTENTION  GET CLOSER TO HER AND TO INTEREST HIS HEART WITH CONSIDERATIONS INDEPENDENT OF THOSE THAT DETERMINE MOST MARRIAGES WERE PROBABLY ON THE CONTRARY  THE MAIN OBJECT OF THESE MYSTERIOUS APPEARANCES WHICH LOTHARIO HAD WANTED TO ENVELOP HIMSELF IN  THAT THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY  THE MOST INEXPLICABLE OF THE FACTS THAT REPORTED TO HIM  WERE PROBABLY ONLY LIES CLEVERLY INSINUATED TO THE PEOPLE OF ANTONIA BY APOSTATE PEOPLE  WITH THE INTENTION OF INCREASING THE UNCERTAINTY WHERE ONE WANTED THE HOLD BACK  AND THIS LAST CONJECTURE WAS NOT ITSELF DEVOID OF EVIDENCE  BECAUSE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEAL THAT LOTHARIO WOULD HAVE TAKEN A LARGE PART IN THE LAST EVENTS OF LIFE FROM ANTONIA  IT WAS  ALL THINGS CONSIDERED  THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD PASSED NEAR HER ON THE RETURN FROM THE FARNEDO  SINGING THE CHORUS OF MORLAQUE  AND THIS YOUNG MAN WAS NOT WITHOUT DESIGN IN TRIESTE  THE APPARITIONS WHICH SO OFTEN ALARMED ANTONIA  AND WHICH HAD INSPIRED SO MUCH CONCERN IN MME ALBERTI  WHEN SHE LOOKED AT THEM LIKE THE ILLUSIONS OF A SICK MIND  COULD ALSO PROCEED OF THE SAME CAUSE  IF SHE HAD EXAGGERATED OR CHANGED A FEW CIRCUMSTANCES  IT IS CHARACTERISTIC OF WEAK SOULS WHO HAVE EVERYTHING TO TO FEAR  AND TENDER SOULS WHO BELIEVE THEY WILL NEVER INTEREST ENOUGH  FINALLY  THE DUINO EVENT WAS NOT EXPLAINED  HOW   OR  WHAT BRIGANDS  ANIMATED BY PILLAGE AND ASSASSINATION  WOULD THEY HAVE YIELDED TO THE MERE APPEARANCE OF A YOUNG ARMENIAN MONK  IF THIS MAN FORMIDABLE BY ITS VALUE AND PERHAPS BY ITS FAME DO NOT HAD NOT IMPOSED AN INVINCIBLE TERROR  BY RUSHING FROM THE CAR WHERE MME ALBERTI HAD GRANTED HIM A PLACE  NO DOUBT THAT HE HAD KNOCKED OVER SEVERAL AROUND HIM BEFORE HE DISPERSE  AND THEN UNDECIDED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT  ON A ROAD HE HAD NEVER TRAVELED  HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE INABILITY TO JOIN HIS TRAVELING COMPANIONS  WHAT WOULD BE THIS MONK ARMED AGAINST THE STATUTES OF HIS ORDER  AND WHO DEVOTES HIMSELF WITH SO MUCH COURAGE AND FORGETTING HIMSELF FOR A FEW STRANGERS  IF NOT A LOVER IN DISGUISE WHO WANTS TO SAVE ANTONIA OR WHO WANTS TO DIE FOR HER  IF THE POSTILION S PIOUS VISION WERE  AS THERE WAS NO DOUBT  THE ERROR OF A MAN OF THE PEOPLE COMPLETELY DEPRIVED OF LIGHTS  WHAT EXPLANATION COULD BE SUBSTITUTE FOR THAT OF MME ALBERTI  THERE WERE STILL QUESTIONABLE THINGS AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE  BUT IT WOULD BE ASTONISHING IF THERE WERE NOT POINT IN THE LIFE OF A MAN WHO SEEKS TO MULTIPLY AROUND HIM UNCERTAINTIES AND MYSTERIES  AND WHO HAS ALL THE SKILL NECESSARY TO PREPARE  COMBINE AND PROMOTE THE MEANS THAT EMPLOYS FOR THIS PURPOSE  LOTHARIO LOVED  HE ADORED ANTONIA  AND ALL HIS ACTIONS ANNOUNCED  MOREOVER  SUCH A JUDICIOUS MAN AND SO ENLIGHTENED  THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ATTRIBUTE THE ODDITY APPARENT OF SOME OF HIS APPROACHES THROUGH THE MIND  HE HAD HIS REASONS  AND WHY LOOK FOR THEM BEFORE TIME  WHAT WAS IMPORTANT FOR MRS ALBERTI WAS TO TO GET TO KNOW LOTHARIO BETTER  TO ENSURE MORE FREQUENT HABIT OF THAT PERFECTION OF CHARACTER THAT GENERAL OPINION ATTRIBUTED TO HIM  AND TO SEE THE FEELINGS SHE HAD ONLY SUSPECTED UNTIL THEN  LOTHARIO DID NOT RUN AWAY FROM THESE GENERAL MEETINGS WHERE EVERYONE IS DEPENDENT ON HIS TALENT  HE AVOIDED PARTICULAR SOCIETIES  WHERE TO BRING CONFIDENCE OR AFFECTIONS  AND IT WAS VERY RARE  AS MATTEO HAD OBSERVED  THAT HE CONSENTED TO APPEAR MORE THAN ONCE  HOWEVER  HE SEIZED WITH EAGERNESS  WHEN IT WAS PRESENTED TO HIM  THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE MRS  ALBERTI AND HIS SISTER  AND THIS SINGULARITY  PROMPTLY NOTICED BY EVERYONE  RID ANTONIA OF A LOT OF PRETENSIONS BORING  A VISIT FROM LOTHARIO SEEMED LIKE A GAIT  AND A STEP BY LOTHARIO EXCLUDED EVEN MEN WHO COULD TO COMPETE WITH IT  AS TO CERTAIN ADVANTAGES  BECAUSE IT RETAINED ADVANTAGES OVER THEM WHICH ARE NEVER OVERLOOKED BY THE VULGAR AND BY THE IMAGINATION OF EVEN THE MOST ENAMORED WOMEN SPARKLE AND NOISE  A SERIOUS SOUL  AN IMPOSING CHARACTER AND A HIDDEN LIFE    WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE IMPRESSION ANTONIA HAD AT THE SIGHT OF LOTHARIO DID NOT RESEMBLE THOSE WHICH ANNOUNCE THE BIRTH OF THE FIRST LOVE IN ORDINARY HEARTS  A GOOD CIRCUMSTANCE INDIFFERENT IN ITSELF  AND WHOSE EFFECT WAS NOT COMPLETELY DESTROYED  THIS SINGULAR ILLUSION OF ICE WHERE LOTHARIO APPEARED TO HIM  HAD MIXED WITH IT A SORT OF CONFUSION AND INDEFINABLE TERROR  THE INTEREST SHE TOOK IN LOTHARIO  THE INCLINATION WHICH DREW HER TOWARDS HIM  HOWEVER  HAD NO LESS POWER TO HAVE LESS SOFTNESS  IT BORE A PRINT OF FATALITY WHICH SURPRISED  WHICH SOMETIMES TERRIFIED ANTONIA  BUT FROM WHICH SHE DID NOT TRY TO DEFEND HERSELF  SINCE MME ALBERTI APPROVED OF THIS FEELING  AND EVEN FOUND SOME PLEASURE IN IT  FEED  YET SHE WAS ASTONISHED THAT LOVE WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM THE IDEA SHE HAD MADE OF IT  ON THE TENDER PAINTINGS AND PASSIONATE ABOUT NOVELISTS AND POETS  SHE STILL COULDN T SEE THAN AN AUSTERE AND MENACING CHAIN THAT WRAPPED HER IN TIES INFLEXIBLE  AND WHICH SHE WOULD HAVE TRIED IN VAIN TO SHAKE OFF THE WEIGHT  ONLY WHEN LOTHARIO  DISTRACTED FOR HER FROM HIS DARK REVERIES  DEIGNED TO INDULGE FOR A MOMENT WITH A NATURAL FULL OF GRACE IN THE SIMPLE CONVERSATIONS OF FAMILIAR FRIENDSHIP  WHEN THIS GATHERING PRIDE  WHEN THIS PAINFUL TENSION OF SPIRIT  WHICH GAVE HIS PHYSIOGNOMY SUCH A MAJESTIC DIGNITY AND SO SAD AT THE SAME TIME  GAVE WAY TO A SWEET ABANDON  WHEN A SMILE CAME TO BLOOM ON THIS MOUTH WHICH HAD SINCE LONG LOST THE HABIT  AND GAVE HIS SEVERE FEATURES A FRANK AND PURE SERENITY  ANTONIA  TRANSPORTED WITH A JOY THAT SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN  UNDERSTOOD SOMETHING OF THE HAPPINESS OF LOVING A BEING SIMILAR TO ONESELF  AND TO BE LOVED WITHOUT SHARING  IT WAS AGAIN LOTHARIO WHO GAVE BIRTH TO HER  BUT IT WAS LOTHARIO STRIPPED OF THAT JE NE SAIS QUOI OF STRANGE AND DREADFUL ALARMED HIS TENDERNESS  IT IS TRUE THAT THESE MOMENTS WERE RARE  AND THAT THEY PASSED QUICKLY  BUT ANTONIA ENJOYED IT WITH SO DRUNKENNESS THAT SHE HAD MANAGED TO NO LONGER DESIRE ANOTHER CONGRATULATED  AND SHE WAS SO LITTLE MISTRESS THEN TO CONCEAL THIS THAT SHE FELT THAT LOTHARIO COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN FOR LONG  FROM THE FIRST TIME HE OBSERVED IT  WE NOTICED THAT IT WAS NOT WITHOUT BITTERNESS FOR HIM  HIS FOREHEAD DARKENS  HIS BREAST SWELLED  HE PRESSED HIS HAND FIRMLY TO HER EYES AND HE WENT OUT  FROM THEN ON  HE SMILES EVEN MORE RARELY  AND  WHEN THAT HAPPENED TO HIM  HE HASTENED TO TURN A WORRIED EYE ON ANTONIA AND GRIEF    HIS LOVE FOR HER WAS NO LONGER A SECRET  WE FELT THAT ALL HIS THOUGHTS  ALL HIS WORDS  ALL HIS ACTIONS ARE REPORTED TO HER  THAT SHE WAS THE SOLE IDEA AND THE SOLE PURPOSE OF HIS LIFE  MADAME ALBERTI HAD NO DOUBTS  AND ANTONIA SAID TO HERSELF SOMETIMES TO HERSELF IN A MOVEMENT OF PRIDE THAT SHE HAD TROUBLE TO REPRESS  BUT THE LOVE OF LOTHARIO  MARKED WITH A SEAL PARTICULAR  LIKE THE ENTIRE EXISTENCE OF THIS INCONCEIVABLE MAN  HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE FEELING THAT BEARS THE SAME NAME IN SOCIETY  IT WAS A SERIOUS AND THOUGHTFUL AFFECTION  MISERLY OF DEMONSTRATIONS AND TRANSPORT  WHICH WAS BARELY SATISFIED  AND WHO MEDITATED ON HERSELF WITH EXCESSIVE RESERVE AS SOON AS SHE COULD FEAR BEING HEARD TOO WELL  THE THE FIRE OF HIS GLANCES OFTEN BETRAYED HIM  BUT TO THE EXPRESSION INEFFABLE OF THE CHASTE AND SWEET FEELING THAT SOON FILLED THE ATTACK OF THIS TEMPORARY FEVER  LOTHARIO NO LONGER SEEMED A LOVER  HE LOOKED LIKE A FATHER WITH ONLY ONE DAUGHTER LEFT  ONLY ONE GIRL  AND WHO HAS CONCENTRATED IN HERSELF ALL THE AFFECTIONS THAT HE HAD BEEN ALLOWED ONE DAY TO SHARE BETWEEN OTHER CHILDREN  HE THEN REVEALED HIMSELF IN HIS PASSION FOR ANTONIA SOMETHING MORE POWERFUL  GREATER THAN LOVE  A DOMINANT DESIRE FOR PROTECTION SO BENEVOLENT AND SO GUARDIAN THAT ONE WOULD NOT PAINT OTHERWISE THAT OF THE ANGEL OF LIGHT WHICH WATCHES OVER THE GUARD OF VIRTUE  AND WHICH ESCORTS IT SINCE THE CRADLE TO THE GRAVE  IT WAS ALSO THE KIND OF ASCENDANT THAT HE EXERCISED ON THIS YOUNG GIRL  AND THAT ONE COULD NOT COMPARE TO NOTHING IN THE ORDER OF PURELY HUMAN RELATIONS  IMAGINATION TENDER AND A LITTLE SUPERSTITIOUS ANTONIA HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THIS IDEA IN THE CROWD OF HYPOTHESES THAT INCOMPREHENSIBLE EXISTENCE DE LOTHARIO MADE HIM CONCEIVE AND REJECT IN TURN  BUT SHE PLAYED WITH HERSELF AND WITH MME ALBERTI  AS IF ILLUSION WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE  LOTHARIO WAS CALLED  IN THEIR PRIVACY  ANTONIA ANGEL      IX    ALAS  THE SWEETEST PROSPECT THAT CAN FLATTER MY HEART  IT IS ANNIHILATION  OH  DON T GO WRONG  ONLY HOPE WHICH REMAINS TO ME  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I WOULD NOW DARE TO BEG MY JUDGE TO ANNIHILATE ME  LOOKS TO ME LIKE I LL FIND IT NOW WILLING TO ANSWER ME  SO  OH LOVELY THOUGHT  SO I DON T WOULD BE MORE  I WOULD FALL BACK INTO THE INVIOLABLE CALM OF NOTHINGNESS  ERASED  CUT OFF FROM THE NUMBER OF BEINGS  FORGOTTEN FROM ALL CREATURES  ANGELS AND GOD HIMSELF  ALMIGHTY GOD  ME HERE IS  DEIGN TO RETURN ME TO THE CHAOS FROM WHICH YOU PULLED ME   KLOPSTOCK    ONE DAY  WHEN THE SUN WAS GOING DOWN  ANTONIA HAD ENTERED THE CHURCH OF ST  MARK TO PRAY  THE LAST RAYS OF TWILIGHT EXPIRED THROUGH THE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS UNDER THE GREAT HANGERS OF THE DOME  AND WERE COMPLETELY EXTINGUISHED IN THE RECESSES OF THE CHAPELS DISTANT  WE COULD BARELY SEE A FEW DYING REFLECTIONS SHINE THE MOST VISIBLE PARTS OF THE MOSAICS OF THE VAULT AND WALLS  FROM THERE THE GROWING SHADOWS DESCENDED MORE AND MORE THICK ALONG THE STRONG COLUMNS OF THE NAVE  AND ENDED FLOOD WITH DEEP AND STILL DARKNESS THE UNEVEN SURFACE OF ITS COBBLESTONES  FURROWED LIKE THE SEA WHICH SURROUNDS THEM  AND WHICH OFTEN EVEN IN THE HOLY PLACE TO RECONQUER ITS EMPIRE ON THE HUMAN USURPATIONS  SHE SAW  A FEW STEPS FROM HER  A KNEELING MAN  WHOSE ATTITUDE HERALDED A SOUL STRONGLY CONCERNED  AT THE SAME MOMENT ONE OF THE CLERS OF THE CHURCH CAME TO LAY A LAMP IN FRONT OF A MIRACULOUS IMAGE  SUSPENDED IN THIS PLACE  AND THE FLAME STIRRED BY THE MOVEMENT OF HIS MARCH SPREAD AROUND OF HIM A WEAK AND FLEETING CLARITY  BUT WHICH SUFFICES FOR ANTONIA TO RECOGNIZE LOTHARIO  HE GOT UP IN A HURRY AND HE WAS ABOUT TO DISAPPEAR  WHEN ANTONIA MET HIS FOOTSTEPS ON THE SQUARE  SHE GRABBED HIS ARM  AND WALKED FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT TALK TO HIM  THEN  WITH AN EFFUSION FULL OF TENDERNESS     WHAT  LOTHARIO    SHE SAID    WHAT CONCERN YOU TORMENTED  WOULD YOU BLUSH TO BE A CHRISTIAN  AND THIS BELIEF IS SHE SO UNWORTHY OF A STRONG SOUL THAT YOU DARE NOT ADMIT IT BEFORE HIS FRIENDS  AS FOR ME  THE GREATEST OF MY SORROWS  I CAN YOU ASSURE IT  WAS TO DOUBT YOUR FAITH  AND I FEEL RELIEVED DEATH PENALTY SINCE I M SURE WE RECOGNIZE THE SAME GOD  AND EXPECT THE SAME FUTURE      ALAS  WHAT ARE YOU SAYING  DEAR ANTONIA    LOTHARIO REPLIED    WHY MUST MY BAD DESTINY HAVE BROUGHT THIS EXPLANATION  HOWEVER I WILL NOT AVOID HIM  HE IS TOO AWFUL TO ABUSE A SOUL LIKE YOURS  THE MAN  POORLY ORGANIZED PERHAPS  WHO DOES NOT BELIEVE IN THE RELIGION IN WHICH HE WAS BORN  WHO  MORE STILL UNHAPPY  DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE GREAT INTELLIGENCE THAT RULE THE WORLD  NOR THE IMMORTAL LIFE OF THE SOUL  IS MORE WORTHY OF PITY THAN OF HORROR  BUT IF HE HID HIS UNBELIEF UNDER PIOUS PRACTICES  IF HE WORSHIPED ONLY TO DECEIVE EVERYONE WHAT THE WORLD ADORES  IF HIS SUPERB REASON DISAVOWED THE HOMAGE WHICH HE GIVES TO PUBLIC WORSHIP AT THE VERY MOMENT HE PROSTRATES HIMSELF WITH THE FAITHFUL  THIS MAN WOULD BE A MONSTER OF HYPOCRISY  THE MOST TREACHEROUS AND ODIOUS OF CREATURES  SEE MY HEART IN ALL ITS INFIRMITY AND IN ALL ITS MISERY  BALANCE SINCE CHILDHOOD BETWEEN THE NEED AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF BELIEVING  DEVOURED WITH THIRST FOR ANOTHER LIFE AND IMPATIENCE TO GET THERE RISE  BUT PURSUED BY THE CONVICTION OF NOTHINGNESS  AS OF A FURY ATTACHED TO MY EXISTENCE  I HAVE LONG  OFTEN  EVERYWHERE SOUGHT THAT GOD THAT MY DESPAIR IMPLORES  IN THE CHURCHES  IN TEMPLES  MOSQUES  SCHOOLS OF PHILOSOPHERS AND PRIESTS  IN ALL OF NATURE  WHO SHOW IT TO ME AND WHO REFUSE  WHEN THE NIGHT  ALREADY LATE  ALLOWS ME TO PENETRATE UNDER THESE VAULTS  AND TO HUMILIATE MYSELF WITHOUT BEING SEEN ON THE STEPS OF THIS SANCTUARY  I COME HERE TO BEG GOD TO COMMUNICATE HIMSELF TO ME  MY VOICE BEGS IT  MY HEART CALLS IT  AND NOTHING ANSWERS ME  MORE FREQUENTLY  BECAUSE THEN I M MORE SURE NOT TO CHEAT ON A WITNESS BY MISINTERPRETED DEMONSTRATIONS  IT IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WOODS  IT IS ON THE SAND OF THE SHORES  IT IS LYING ON A BOAT ABANDONED IN THE SEA  THAT I INVOKE THIS LIGHT FROM THE SKY  WHOSE GENTLE INFLUENCE WOULD CURE ME OF ALL MY ILLS  HOW MUCH TIMES AND WITH WHAT FERVOR  O HEAVEN  I BOWED DOWN TO THIS IMMENSE CREATION BY ASKING ITS AUTHOR  HOW MUCH I HAVE SHED TEARS OF RAGE  WHEN  DESCENDING INTO MY HEART  I FOUND ONLY DOUBT  IGNORANCE AND DEATH  ANTONIA  YOU TREMBLE TO HEAR ME  FORGIVE ME  PITY ME  AND REST ASSURED  THE BLINDNESS OF AN UNFORTUNATE  DISOWNED BY HEAVEN  PROVES NOTHING AGAINST THE FAITH OF A SIMPLE SOUL  BELIEVE  ANTONIA  YOUR GOD EXISTS  YOUR SOUL IS IMMORTAL  YOUR RELIGION IS TRUE  BUT THIS GOD HAS DISTRIBUTED HIS GRACES AND HIS PUNISHMENTS WITH THE FAR SIGHTED INTELLIGENCE WHICH REIGNS IN ALL HIS WORKS  HE HAS GIVEN THE FOREKNOWLEDGE OF IMMORTALITY TO PURE SOULS FOR WHOM IMMORTALITY IS DONE  TO THE SOULS HE HAS DEVOTED IN ADVANCE TO NOTHING  HE ONLY SHOWED NOTHING      NOTHINGNESS    CRIED ANTONIA    LOTHARIO  DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT  AH  MY FRIEND  YOUR SOUL IS NOT DEVOTED TO NOTHINGNESS  YOU WILL BELIEVE  IF NOT THAT ONE MOMENT  ONLY ONE MOMENT  BUT THE MOMENT WILL COME WHEN IMMORTALITY WILL BE FELT IN LOTHARIO S REASON  AS IN HIS HEART  LOTHARIO S SOUL WOULD BE MORTAL  ALMIGHTY GOD  AND TO OF WHAT USE WOULD THE WHOLE CREATION BE  IF LOTHARIO S SOUL HAD TO FINISH  OH  FOR ME    SHE CONTINUED MORE CALMLY    I FEEL THAT I WILL LIVE  THAT I WILL NEVER END  THAT I WILL OWN EVERYTHING THAT WAS SO DEAR TO ME  IN A FUTURE WITHOUT VICISSITUDE  MY FATHER  MY MOTHER  MY GOOD SISTER     AND I KNOW THAT ALL THE PAINS OF THE MOST PAINFUL LIFE  ALL THE TRIALS TO WHICH PROVIDENCE CAN SUBJECT A WEAK CREATURE IN THIS SHORT PASSAGE FROM BIRTH TO DEATH WILL NEVER REDUCE ME TO ABSOLUTE DESPAIR  BECAUSE ETERNITY REMAINS FOR ME TO LOVE AND TO BE LOVED      TO LOVE  ANTONIA    SAID LOTHARIO    WHAT MAN IS WORTHY TO BE LOVED BY YOU      HE FINISHED THESE WORDS BY ENTERING MADAME ALBERTI S LIVING ROOM  WHO SMILED MEANINGFULLY AT HIM  LOTHARIO SMILES TOO  BUT IT WAS NOT FROM THIS ENCHANTING SMILE THAT A DISTRACTION HAPPY SOMETIMES TOOK HIM AWAY  IT WAS WITH A BITTER SMILE AND PAIN THAT SEEMED FOREIGN TO HIS FACE    ANTONIA BEGAN TO FIND AN EXPLANATION FOR THE DEEP LOTHARIO S SADNESS  SHE UNDERSTOOD HOW THIS UNFORTUNATE  DEPRIVED OF THE SWEETEST FAVOR OF PROVIDENCE  OF THE HAPPINESS OF KNOW GOD AND LOVE HIM  AND CAST TO EARTH AS A AIMLESS TRAVELER  HAD TO LOOK FORWARD TO PROVIDING THIS CAREER USELESS AND LONGING FOR WHEN TO GET OUT OF IT FOREVER  HE MOREOVER SEEMED THAT HE WAS ALONE IN THE WORLD  BECAUSE HE DID NOT SPEAK NEVER FROM HIS PARENTS  IF HE HAD ONCE KNOWN A MOTHER  HE WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE NAMED HER  FOR A MAN WHO WAS NOT BOUND BY NO FEELING  THIS IMMENSE VOID IN WHICH HIS SOUL WAS IMMERSED COULD FAIL TO BE FRIGHTENING AND TERRIBLE  AND ANTONIA  WHO HAD NEVER SUPPOSED THAT A CREATURE COULD FALL INTO THIS EXCESS OF MISERY AND LONELINESS  DID NOT CONTEMPLATE IT WITHOUT FEAR  SHE REFLECTED ESPECIALLY WITH AN EXTREME PANG OF HEART AT THIS IDEA OF   LOTHARIO  THAT THERE WAS FOR CERTAIN BEINGS REPROBATE OF GOD A PREDESTINATION OF NOTHINGNESS WHICH MADE THEIR WOE IN THIS WORLD OF THE CONVICTION NOT TO LIVE AGAIN IN A OTHER  SHE THOUGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME OF THIS DREADFUL NOTHINGNESS  OF THE DEEP  TO THE IMMEASURABLE HORROR OF THIS SEPARATION ETERNAL  SHE PUT HERSELF IN THE PLACE OF THE UNFORTUNATE WHO DID NOT SEE IN LIFE THAN A SUCCESSION OF PARTIAL DEATHS THAT RESULT TO COMPLETE DEATH  AND IN THE MOST DELICIOUS AFFECTIONS THAN THE FLEETING ILLUSION OF TWO HEARTS OF ASH  SHE IMAGINED THE TERROR OF THE HUSBAND WHO PRESSES HIS BELOVED WIFE IN HIS ARMS  WHEN IT COMES TO THINKING THAT AFTER A FEW YEARS  A FEW DAYS PERHAPS  ALL THE CENTURIES WILL BE BETWEEN THEM  AND THAT EACH MOMENT OF THIS PASSING PRESENT IS A DOWN PAYMENT GIVEN TO THE FUTURE UNENDING  AND IN THIS PAINFUL MEDITATION SHE FELT THE THE SAME FEELING AS A POOR AND WEAK CHILD  LOST IN THE WOODS  WHO  FROM ERROR TO ERROR  AND FROM DETOURS TO DETOURS  WOULD BE ARRIVED  WITH NO MEANS OF RECOGNIZING HIS TRACE AND RETURNING TO HIS NOT  TO THE RAPID INCLINATION OF A PRECIPICE  ABSORBED IN THESE REFLECTIONS  AS IF IN A PAINFUL DREAM  SHE HAD RISEN FROM HER SEAT  WHILE MRS  ALBERTI AND LOTHARIO LOOKED AT HER SILENCE  AND SHE HAD REACHED HER ROOM  HARDLY WAS SHE THERE WHEN HIS HEART  FREED FROM ALL EXTERNAL CONSTRAINTS  SUBMITTED WITHOUT RESISTANCE TO THE OPPRESSION THAT OVERWHELMED HIM  AND TASTED THE FREEDOM TO SUFFER WITH A SORT OF PLEASURE  UNTIL THEN THE PASSIONS HAD EXERCISED LITTLE SWAY OVER HER  AND THE VERY LOVE THAT MRS  ALBERTI LOVED TO SEE HER DEVELOP IN HER FOR LOTHARIO NOT THERE WAS NOT MANIFESTED BY THOSE THUNDERSTORMS THAT ACCOMPANY THE FEELINGS EXALTED  WHICH INCREASE THE ACTION OF LIFE  AND WHICH ALL THE FACULTIES AT THEIR HIGHEST DEGREE OF POWER  SHE HAD CONCEIVED THAT SHE LOVED LOTHARIO  AND THIS PERSUASION FULL OF GENTLENESS AND ABANDON HAD COST NOTHING TO HIS HAPPINESS  BUT THIS THOUGHT OF ANNIHILATION OR DAMNATION  DAMNATION  THE ANNIHILATION OF LOTHARIO  STIRRED UP IN HIS HEART THE IDEAS MOST TUMULTUOUS AND FILLED HIM WITH CONFUSION AND TERROR     WHAT    SHE SAID    BEYOND THIS LIFE SO QUICKLY NOTHING ELAPSED  NOTHING MORE FOR HIM  AND IT IS HE WHO THINKS IT  AND IT IS HE WHO SAYS IT  AND IT IS HE WHO THREATENS US NOT TO SEE HIM AGAIN NEVER IN THE PLACE WHERE WE WILL MEET AGAIN TO NEVER LEAVE EACH OTHER      NOTHINGNESS  WHAT THEN IS NOTHINGNESS  AND WHAT ETERNITY IF LOTHARIO IS NOT THERE      WHILE SHE WAS TRYING TO REALIZE THIS THOUGHT  SHE HAD UNKNOWINGLY DRAWN NEAR TO HER CHRIST  AND HER HAND LEANED ON ONE OF THE WOODS OF THE CROSS  SHE LOOKED UP  AND FELL TO HIS KNEES      MY GOD  MY GOD    SHE CRIED    YOU TO WHOM SPACE AND ETERNITY BELONG  YOU WHO CAN DO EVERYTHING AND WHO LOVE SO MUCH  HAVE YOU DONE NOTHING FOR LOTHARIO     AS SHE SAID THESE WORDS  ANTONIA FELT HERSELF FAINT  BUT SHE WAS RECALLED TO HER BY THE IMPRESSION OF A SUPPORTING HAND  THAT OF MME ALBERTI  WHO HAD LEFT LOTHARIO TO FOLLOW HER  FOR FEAR THAT SHE WOULD BE ILL          CALM DOWN  POOR ANTONIA   SAID MME ALBERTI TO HIM    YOUR ANCESTORS GAVE PRINCES TO THE EAST  AND YOUR FORTUNE IS COUNTED BY MILLIONS  YOU WILL BE LOTHARIO S WIFE  WHEN HE IS A SON KING S      WHAT DOES IT MATTER    ANSWERED ANTONIA WITH A BEWILDERED AIR    WHO CARES IF HE DOES NOT RISE AGAIN      MRS  ALBERTI  WHO COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THESE WORDS  SHOOK HIS HEAD IN PAIN  LIKE A SELF CONFIRMED PERSON DESPITE HERSELF IN A SAD CONVICTION THAT SHE HAS FOR A LONG TIME AND UNNECESSARILY PUSHED BACK     UNHAPPY CHILD    SHE SAID HUGGING HER AND WATERING HER WITH HER TEARS   HOW YOU HURT YOUR SISTER  AH  IF HEAVEN RESERVES YOU FOR THIS MISFORTUNE  MAY I AT LEAST DIE BEFORE WITNESSING IT        X   WE ARE DECEIVED WITHOUT HAVING ENJOYED  THERE ARE STILL DESIRES  AND WE NO LONGER HAVE ILLUSIONS  THE IMAGINATION IS RICH  ABUNDANT AND WONDERFUL  THE POOR  DRY AND DISENCHANTED EXISTENCE  WE LIVE WITH A FULL HEART AN EMPTY WORLD  AND WITHOUT HAVING USED ANYTHING WE ARE DISILLUSIONED WITH EVERYTHING   CHATEAUBRIAND    LOTHARIO S INTIMACY HAD BECOME A NEED FOR ANTONIA  WHOM THE HOPE OF RETURNING HIS HEART TO FAITH IGNITED WITH ZEAL FULL OF TENDERNESS  AND WHO ALREADY LOVED HER DEARLY BEFORE CONFESSED THAT SHE LOVED HIM  SHE WAS NO LESS PRECIOUS TO MADAME ALBERTI  WHO  MORE AND MORE WORRIED ABOUT THE FATE OF A YOUNG GIRL WITHOUT SUPPORT  WHO ENTERED THE WORLD  WITH AN ORGANIZATION WEAKLING  FAILING HEALTH  AND AN EXTREME DISPOSITION TO ENDURE PAINFULLY ALL STRONG IMPRESSIONS  DID NOT CONCEIVE OF POSSIBILITY OF ENSURING HIM SOME HAPPINESS BY GIVING HIM FIND  IN A STRONGLY FELT AFFECTION  A PROTECTION OF MORE AGAINST THE WRINKLES OF LIFE  SHE SAW A BIG ADVANTAGE OF HELPING EARLY THE ALMOST MATERNAL ATTACHMENT THAT SHE HAD FOR HER SISTER  THE HELP OF A MORE TENDER FEELING EVEN MORE FAR SIGHTED  AS ANTONIA DOUBTLESS HAD INSPIRED IN LOTHARIO  THOUGH  BY A SINGULARITY DIFFICULT TO TO DEFINE  HE AVOIDED RELATING WHAT HE FELT SO EVIDENTLY TO NO PARTICULAR BEING  IT LOOKED LIKE IT HAD FORMED IN A HIGHER WORLD SOME ADMIRABLE TYPE OF PERFECTION WHOSE ANTONIA S FIGURE AND CHARACTER ONLY REMINDED HIM OF THE MEMORY  AND THAT IF HE FIXED HIS GAZE ON HER WITH A ATTENTION SO LIVELY AND SO TENDER  IT WAS BECAUSE HIS FEATURES WOKE UP A REMINISCENCE WHOSE OBJECT WAS NOT ON EARTH  THIS CIRCUMSTANCE HAD MAINTAINED IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP A SORT OF PAINFUL MYSTERY  WHICH WAS A BURDEN TO ALL  BUT THAT TIME ALONE COULD CLEAR UP  ANTONIA WAS QUITE HAPPY BESIDES THE FRIENDSHIP OF A MAN LIKE LOTHARIO  AND HIS SOUL  SHY AND DEFIANT  WHO WELL UNDERSTOOD ANOTHER HAPPINESS  WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO DESIRE  HER LIFE WAS EMBELLISHED WITH THE IDEA THAT SHE OCCUPIED LIFE OF LOTHARIO  AND THAT SHE HAD TAKEN IN THE THOUGHTS OF THIS MAN EXTRAORDINARY A PLACE THAT NOBODY  PERHAPS  SHARED WITH HER  AS FOR LOTHARIO  HIS MELANCHOLY INCREASED EVERY DAYS  AND INCREASED ABOVE ALL BY WHAT SEEMED PECULIAR TO THE DISPEL  OFTEN  SHAKING HANDS WITH MADAME ALBERTI  RESTING HIS EYES ON ANTONIA S SWEET SMILE  HE HAD SPOKEN OF HIS DEPARTURE WITH A STIFLED SIGH  AND HIS EYELIDS WERE WET WITH TEARS    THIS MELANCHOLY DISPOSITION OF THE MIND WHICH WAS COMMON TO THEM KEPT THEM AWAY FROM PUBLIC PLACES AND NOISY PLEASURES TO WHICH THE VENETIANS ARE ENGAGED DURING THE GREATER PART OF THE YEAR  THEIR TIME WAS USUALLY SPENT WALKING ON THE LAGOONS  IN THE ISLANDS THAT ARE SCATTERED THERE  OR IN THE PRETTY VILLAGES OF THE MAINLAND BORDERING THE ELEGANT BANKS OF THE BRENTA  HOWEVER  OF ALL THE PLACES THEY LIKED TO MEET  THERE WAS NONE THAT OFFERED THEM MORE CHARMS THAN AN ISLAND NARROW AND ELONGATED  WHICH THE INHABITANTS OF VENICE CALL THE LIDO  OR THE SHORE  BECAUSE IT IN FACT ENDS THE LAGOONS OF SIDE OF THE GREAT SEA  AND THAT IT IS LIKE THEIR LIMIT  NATURE SEEMS TO HAVE IMPRINTED ON THIS PLACE A PARTICULAR CHARACTER OF SADNESS  SOLEMNITY  WHICH ONLY AWAKENS FEELINGS TENDER  WHICH ONLY EXCITES SERIOUS AND DREAMY IDEAS  FROM THE SIDE ONLY WHERE IT HAS A VIEW OF VENICE  THE LIDO IS COVERED WITH GARDENS  PRETTY ORCHARDS  SIMPLE BUT PICTURESQUE LITTLE HOUSES  ON THE BEAUTIFUL FESTIVE DAYS OF THE YEAR  IT IS THE MEETING PLACE FOR PEOPLE OF THE PEOPLE  WHO COME HERE TO RELAX FROM THE FATIGUE OF THE WEEK  THROUGH GAMES AND COUNTRY DANCES  FROM THERE  VENICE DEVELOPS TO THE EYES IN ALL ITS MAGNIFICENCE  THE CANAL  COVERED WITH GONDOLAS  PRESENTS IN ITS VAST EXTENT THE IMAGE OF A RIVER IMMENSE  WHICH BATHES THE FOOT OF THE DUCAL PALACE AND THE STEPS OF SAINT MARC  A BITTER THOUGHT GRIPS THE HEART  WHEN WE CAN DISTINGUISH BELOW ITS MAJESTIC DOMES THE WALLS BLACKENED BY TIME OF THE STATE INQUISITION  AND WHEN WE TRY TO COUNT SEPARATELY THE COUNTLESS VICTIMS OF A WORRIED AND JEALOUS TYRANNY THAT THESE DUNGEONS HAVE DEVOURED    GOING UP TOWARDS THE CREST OF THE LIDO  ONE FEELS ATTRACTED BY THE ASPECT OF A GROVE OF OAKS WHICH OCCUPIES ALL THE MOST HIGH  WHICH EXTENDS AS A CURTAIN OF GREENERY ABOVE THE LANDSCAPE  OR WHICH IS DIVIDED HERE AND THERE INTO COOL AND SHADY GROUPS  ONE WOULD BELIEVE AT FIRST GLANCE  THAT THIS PLACE  FAVORABLE TO PLEASURE  DOES NOT CONTAINS OTHER MYSTERIES THAN THOSE OF PLEASURE  HE IS DEDICATED TO THE MYSTERIES OF DEATH  A GREAT NUMBER OF SCATTERED GRAVES  LOADED WITH SINGULAR AND UNINTELLIGIBLE CHARACTERS FOR THE MOST WALKERS SEEM TO ANNOUNCE THE LAST REST OF A PEOPLE ERASED FROM THE EARTH  WHO LEFT NO OTHER MONUMENTS  THIS IMPOSING IDEA WHICH BRINGS TOGETHER  WHICH CONFUSES WITH THE FEELING OF THE BREVITY OF LIFE  THAT OF THE ANTIQUITY OF TIME  HAS SOMETHING LARGER AND MORE AUSTERE THAN THAT THAT IS BORN ON THE FUNERAL STONE OF A MAN WE HAVE KNOWN LIVING  BUT IT IS ONLY A MISTAKE  WE DIDN T DO A FEW NOT JUST THE MEETING OF A WHITER STONE  ADORNED WITH A MORE MODERN WAY  AND OFTEN STILL SOWN WITH SCARCELY FADED THAT CONJUGAL LOVE  FILIAL PIETY IN MOURNING DISPELS THIS ILLUSION  THESE UNKNOWN LETTERS ARE BORROWED FROM THE LANGUAGE OF A NATION TO WHICH GOD HAS PROMISED NOT TO END  AND WHO LIVES SEPARATE FROM THE MEN WITH WHOM SHE HAS NEVER NOT EVEN THE RIGHT TO MIX ITS DUST  IT IS THE CEMETERY OF JEWS  GOING BACK DOWN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF VENICE  SUDDENLY THE TREES BECOME RARER  POWDERY AND WITHERED GRASS DOES NOT POINTS OUT MORE THAN SPACE TO SPACE  THE VEGETATION DISAPPEARS ALTOGETHER  AND THE FOOT SINKS INTO A LIGHT SAND  MOBILE  SILVERY  WHICH COVERS ALL THIS SIDE OF THE LIDO  AND WHICH ENDS IN THE GREAT SEA  HERE THE POINT OF VIEW CHANGES ENTIRELY  OR RATHER THE STRAY EYE ON A BOUNDLESS SPACE SEARCHES USELESSLY FOR THESE FORESTS OF SUPERB STEEPLES  THESE DAZZLING DOMES  THESE MONUMENTS SUMPTUOUS  THESE ELEGANTLY DECKED BUILDINGS  THESE AGILE GONDOLAS  WHO  A MOMENT BEFORE  OCCUPIED HIM WITH SO MANY DISTRACTIONS SHINY AND FLATTERING  THERE IS NOT A REEF  NOT A SCHOOL OF SAND WHICH RESTS IT IN THIS EXTENDED WAVE  IT IS NO LONGER THE FLAT AND OPAQUE SURFACE OF THE QUIET CHANNELS WHICH DO NOT WRINKLE THE MORE OFTEN THAN UNDER THE LIGHT OAR OF THE GONDOLIER  AND WHICH EMBELLISH  WITH THEIR EQUAL COURSE  STREETS WHERE EACH HOUSE IS A PALACE FIT FOR KINGS  THESE ARE THE STORMY WAVES OF THE SEA INDEPENDENT OF THE SEA WHICH DOES NOT RECEIVE THE LAWS OF MAN  AND WHICH BATHES INDISCRIMINATELY OPULENT CITIES OR STRIKES BARREN AND DESERTED    THIS KIND OF IDEA WAS OF A VERY SERIOUS NATURE TO THE SOUL SHY OF ANTONIA  BUT SHE HAD GRADUALLY BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE DARKEST SCENES AND IMAGES  BECAUSE SHE KNEW THAT LOTHARIO TOOK PLEASURE IN IT  AND THAT HE DID NOT TASTE GENTLY  WITH FULLNESS  THE CHARM OF A COLLECTED CONVERSATION  THAT IN THE MOST RUSTIC SOLITUDES  ENEMY OF THE FORMS OF THE WORLD THAT CONSTRAINED  WHICH SUPPRESSED THE EXPANSION OF ITS ARDENT SENSITIVITY  HE WAS NOT REALLY HIM UNTIL THE CIRCLE OF SOCIETY WAS CROSSED  AND THAT  ALONE WITH NATURE AND FRIENDSHIP  HE COULD GIVE A CAREER TO THE IMPETUOSITY OF HIS THOUGHTS  OFTEN BIZARRE  ALWAYS ENERGETIC AND FRANK  SOMETIMES TALL AND WILD AS THE DESERT THAT INSPIRED HIM  IT IS THEN ESPECIALLY THAT LOTHARIO SEEMED MORE THAN A MAN  IT IS WHEN  FREE FROM THE CONVENIENCES THAT MAKE MAN SMALLER  HE SEEMED TAKE POSSESSION OF A CREATION FROM TIME TO TIME   AND BREATHE IN THE WEIGHT OF SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN A PLACE WHERE THEY DID NOT HAVE PENETRATED  LEANING AGAINST A TREE WITHOUT A CROP  ON A GROUND THAT NOT OF THE TRAVELER HAVE NEVER TROD  HE REMINDED OF SOMETHING THE BEAUTY OF ADAM AFTER HIS FAULT  SEVERAL TIMES ANTONIA HAD IT CONSIDERED IN THIS SITUATION AT THIS UPPER PART OF THE LIDO WHERE THE ISRAELITE CEMETERY IS LOCATED  FROM THERE  WHILE HE LOOKED ALTERNATELY ON VENICE AND THE SEA  HIS PHYSIOGNOMY SO MOBILE  SO ANIMATED  SO EXPRESSIVE  PAINTED WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN HIM WITH AS MUCH CLARITY  AS MUCH PRECISION AS THE SPEECH  WE READ IN HIS EYES THE PAINFUL RAPPROCHEMENT THAT MADE HIS MIND OF THESE INTERMEDIATE TOMBS BETWEEN A WORLD TUMULTUOUS AND ETERNAL MONOTONY OF THE SEAS WITH THE END OF THE LIFE OF MAN  WHO IS ALSO PLACED  PERHAPS  BETWEEN A AIMLESS AGITATION AND ENDLESS INACTION  HIS SIGHT STOPPED PAINFULLY AT THE LAST LIMITS OF THE HORIZON ON THE SIDE OF THE GULF  AS IF IT HAD SOUGHT TO PUSH THEM BACK FURTHER  AND TO FIND BEYOND THAT SOME PROOF AGAINST NOTHINGNESS  ONE DAY ANTONIA  PENETRATED BY THIS IDEA AS IF HE HAD COMMUNICATED IT TO HER  RUSHED UP TO HIM FROM THE MOUND WHERE SHE WAS SITTING  AND  GRABBING HER HAND WITH ALL THE STRENGTH SHE WAS CAPABLE OF     GOD  GOD    SHE CRIED  POINTING HER FINGER AT THE LINE INDECISIVE WHERE THE LAST WAVE MINGLED WITH THE FIRST CLOUD       HE IS HERE      LOTHARIO  LESS SURPRISED THAN TOUCHED TO HAVE BEEN UNDERSTOOD  PRESSED HER AGAINST HER BREAST     GOD WOULD BE LACKING IN ALL NATURE    HE REPLIED    LET HIM BE WOULD FIND IN ANTONIA S HEART      MADAME ALBERTI  WITNESS TO ALL THEIR INTERVIEWS  TOOK LESS OF INTEREST TO THOSE WHO TURNED TO THESE GREAT OBJECTS OF MEDITATION  BECAUSE SHE BELIEVED WITHOUT EFFORT  WITH NAIVE FAITH  AND THAT SHE HAD NEVER SUPPOSED THAT ONE COULD QUESTION THE ONLY IDEAS ON WHICH ARE BASED HAPPINESS AND HOPES OF MAN  SOME CIRCUMSTANCES HAD GIVEN RISE TO BELIEVE THAT LOTHARIO S RELIGIOUS VIEWS WERE NOT AGREE IN EVERYTHING WITH THOSE OF ANTONIA  BUT SHE WAS FAR FROM THINK THAT IT EXTENDED TO THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF ITS BELIEF  AND THIS LITTLE LACK OF HARMONY BETWEEN TWO HEARTS THAT WANTED TO UNITE WORRIED HIM VERY SLIGHTLY  HOWEVER PERFECT IT WAS LOTHARIO  SHE FELT HE COULD BE WRONG  BUT SHE WAS SURE THAT A MAN AS PERFECT AS LOTHARIO COULD NOT ALWAYS DECEIVE      XI   I CRINGE WHEN I SEE THE INJUSTICES HAPPENING COMMIT  AND HOW WE PERSECUTE POOR MISERABLE PEOPLE IN THE NAME JUSTICE AND LAWS   GOETHE    ONE DAY THEIR WALK ENDED LATER THAN USUAL  AT AN HOUR WHEN THE DARKNESS THAT WAS BEGINNING TO SPREAD OVER THE SEA LET VENICE DISTINGUISH MORE THAN THE SCATTERED LIGHTS OF ITS BUILDINGS  IN THE SILENCE WHERE ALL NATURE RESTED  AND WHERE THE EAR EASILY SEIZED THE SLIGHTEST NOISE  THAT OF ANTONIA WAS SUDDENLY STRUCK WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY CRY WHICH WAS NOTHING NEW TO HER  HOWEVER  AND THAT MADE HER WINCE  SHE REMEMBERED HEARING HIM AT THE FARNEDO THE DAY SHE WENT THERE  HAD MET AN OLD MORLAQUE POET  AND SINCE THEN FROM DUINO CASTLE  WHEN THE ARMENIAN MONK HAD RUSHED TO AMONG THE ROBBERS AND SCATTERED THEM BEFORE HIM  SHE IS DREW NEAR TO HIS SISTER BY AN INVOLUNTARY MOVEMENT  AND SOUGHT LOTHARIO S EYE WHO WAS STANDING AT THE BOW OF THE GONDOLA  LITTLE AFTERWARDS  THIS NOISE WAS REPEATED  BUT IT STARTED FROM A POINT MUCH CLOSER  AND AT THE SAME INSTANT THE GONDOLA EXPERIENCED A VIOLENT  AS IF SHE HAD BEEN TOUCHED BY ANOTHER  LOTHARIO WAS NO LONGER THERE  ANTONIA CRIED OUT AND STOOD UP HASTILY  THE CALLER  THE GONDOLA REMAINED MOTIONLESS  A GREAT NOISE THAT IS WAS NEXT FIXED HIS ATTENTION  AND CHANGED HIS DREAD TO CURIOSITY  SHE COULD DISTINGUISH VERY WELL  IN THIS CONFUSED RUMOR  LOTHARIO S VOICE SPEAKING WITH AUTHORITY IN THE MIDST OF A HANDFUL OF MEN ASSEMBLED ON AN OPEN BOAT  HE DOES NOT TOOK A MOMENT TO REALIZE THAT THESE MEN WERE DISGUISED HENCHMEN WHO TOOK A PRISONER TO VENICE  AND WHO COMPLAINED THAT THEY HAD BEEN MADE TO LOSE THEIR PREY  INDIGNANT  IN EFFECT  OF THE VIOLENCE THAT WAS DONE TO THIS WRETCH  AND NOT SEEING  IN THE RIGOROUS TREATMENT HE EXPERIENCED  THAT AN ODIOUS ABUSE OF FORCE  LOTHARIO HAD RUSHED ON THE BUILDING  AND HAD DELIVERED THE STRANGER BY THROWING HIM INTO THE SEA FROM WHERE HE COULD SWIM TO A NEIGHBORING EDGE  THE MINIONS FIRST BROKE OUT IN REPROACHES AND THREATS  FOR THIS PRISONER WAS VERY IMPORTANT  WE EVEN HAD REASON TO THINK THAT HE WAS AN EMISSARY OF JEAN SBOGAR  AND THEY EXPECTED A GREAT PRICE FOR THEIR CAPTURE  BUT THEY RETURNED IN RESPECTFUL SILENCE RECOGNIZING LOTHARIO  WHOSE MYSTERIOUS INFLUENCE ACTED AS A BRAKE  IN THESE TIME OF CRISIS  TO ALL THE EXCESSES OF POWER  AFTER HAVING THEM ADDRESSED A FEW WORDS OF CONTEMPT  HE LET FALL IN THE MIDST OF THEM A HANDFUL OF SEQUINS  AND WENT BACK PEACEFULLY ON THE GONDOLA WHERE HIS RETURN PUT AN END TO ANTONIA S WORRIES  AT THE MOMENT WHEN THEY ENTERED THE CANAL  THE SINGULAR CRY THAT HAD WARNED SOME TIME AGO LOTHARIO S ATTENTION WAS HEARD AGAIN AT THE POINT OF JUDECQUE  ANTONIA ASSUMED THAT THE MAN THAT LOTHARIO HAD JUST PULLED FROM THE HANDS OF THE HENCHMEN WAS APPROACHED IN THIS PLACE  AND LET HIS LIBERATOR KNOW ABOUT IT  TO TEACH HIM THAT HE HAD NOT RECEIVED A BLESSING FROM HIM UNNECESSARY  LOTHARIO SEEMED TO EXPERIENCE A LIVELY TRANSPORT OF JOY  AND THIS FEELING WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE HEART OF ANTONIA  WHO  THROUGH THE VAGUE FEAR WHICH STILL OCCUPIED HIM  GREATLY ENJOYED THE PERFECTION OF LOTHARIO S SOUL  WHOM SHE HAD SEEN ALWAYS READY TO TO REVOLT AGAINST INJUSTICE AND TO DEVOTE ONESELF TO MISFORTUNE  SHE CONCEIVED THAT THIS INVINCIBLE IMPETUOSITY OF FEELINGS EXPOSED HIM TO SOMETIMES FALL INTO DANGEROUS EXCESSES  BUT SHE DID NOT SUPPOSE THAT ONE COULD NEVER BLAME FAULTS TOO NOBLE IN THEIR PATTERN    MADAME ALBERTI RARELY RECEIVED PEOPLE  BECAUSE SHE HAD NOTICED THAT THIS KIND OF DISTRACTION  WHICH CONSISTS THE MOST OFTEN IN AN EXCHANGE OF MUTUALLY INTRUSIVE DECORUM  DID NOT SUIT ANTONIA  WHOSE TASTES DIRECTED HER IN ALL THINGS  HOWEVER  THAT VERY DAY  AGAINST THE ORDINARY  SHE EXPECTED A FAIRLY LARGE COMPANY  WHICH HAPPENED ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME TIME IT  ALREADY  THE NOISE OF THE SINGULAR INCIDENT WHICH CAME FROM HAPPENING HAD SPREAD IN THE GROUPS OF ST  MARK S SQUARE  AND POPULAR OPINION  ALWAYS FAVORABLE TO LOTHARIO  HAD PRESENTED HIS DRIVING IN THE MOST BRILLIANT LIGHT  THE PEOPLE VENETIAN  WHICH IS APPARENTLY THE MOST FLEXIBLE OF ALL AND THE MOST EASY TO ENSLAVE  THIS PEOPLE SO SUBMISSIVE  SO HUMBLE  SO CARESSING FOR HIS MASTERS  IS PERHAPS OF ALL PEOPLES THE MOST JEALOUS OF HIS FREEDOM  AND  IN THOSE MOMENTS OF PUBLIC TURMOIL WHEN THE UNDECIDED POWER PASSED FROM HAND TO HAND AT THE MERCY OF CHANCE  IT ENTHUSIASTICALLY ATTACHED HIMSELF TO ALL THAT SEEMED TO GUARANTEE ITS INDEPENDENCE OR DEFEND IT IN THE ABSENCE OF INSTITUTIONS  THE SLIGHTEST ATTACK ON THE SAFETY OF INDIVIDUALS WORRIED  REVOLTED HIS SHADY IRRITABILITY  AND HE WAS MUCH LESS BROUGHT TO SEE  IN THE MOST LEGITIMATE ACTS OF AUTHORITY  THIS THAT SHE WAS DOING TO MAINTAIN HER SAFETY  THAN WHAT SHE COULD MAKE A DAY TO DESTROY IT  JEAN SBOGAR S NAME WAS ARRIVED IN VENICE LIKE THAT OF A DANGEROUS AND FORMIDABLE MAN  BUT HE HAD NEVER GIVEN ALARMS  BECAUSE HIS TROOP  TOO FEW TO TRY A HAND ON A LARGE CITY  HARDLY CARRIED THE RAVAGES THAT FAME BLAMED ON IT THAN IN A FEW VILLAGES OF TERRE FERME TO WHICH LAGOON DWELLERS WERE AS FOREIGN AS IF THEY HAD ANY BEEN SEPARATED BY IMMENSE SEAS  AN EMISSARY OF JEAN SBOGAR WAS THEREFORE NOT AN ENEMY FOR VENICE  AND ONE COULD NOT SEE USUALLY IN LOTHARIO S ACTION THAT ONE OF THESE MOVEMENTS OF ENERGETIC GENEROSITY WHICH SEEMED SO NATURAL TO HIS CHARACTER  AND WHO HAD ALREADY WON HIM THE AFFECTION OF THE LOWER CLASSES AND THE ESTEEM OF EVERYONE  THE CONVERSATION TURNED NATURALLY ON THIS OBJECT IN MADAME ALBERTI S CIRCLE  DESPITE THE VISIBLE EMBARRASSMENT OF LOTHARIO  WHOSE MODESTY COULD NOT BEAR THE SLIGHTEST PRAISE WITHOUT IMPATIENCE AND NOTHING ONLY ANNOUNCED THIS INEXHAUSTIBLE THESIS IN THE STYLE OF VENETIAN POLITENESS HAD TO END AT LAST SATISFACTION OF THE MAN WHO WAS THE OBJECT  WHEN ANTONIA  TORMENTED BY THE DISCOMFORT MANIFESTED BY HER PHYSIOGNOMY  HASTENED TO SEIZE A LESS FAVORABLE ASPECT OF THIS EVENT TO RELIEVE LOTHARIO WITH THE WEIGHT OF UNWELCOME ADMIRATION     IF  HOWEVER    SHE SAID SMILING    LORD LOTHARIO WAS MISTAKEN ABOUT THE OBJECT OF HIS GENEROUS DEVOTION  IF THE BAD OPINION THAT HE HAS OF THE MINIONS HAD BEEN FOUND THIS TIME IN DEFAULT  IF HE HAD ADDED TO THE MISFORTUNE OF HINDERING THE ACTION OF THE LAWS  AND TO OPPOSE THEM A RESISTANCE WHICH IS ALWAYS REPREHENSIBLE  THAT OF STEALING FROM THE PUNISHMENT DUE TO HIM ONE OF THESE CULPRITS THAT NO CLASS OF SOCIETY CLAIMS  TO BRING INTO THE WORLD SCARED SOME OF THOSE MONSTERS THAT DON T MARK THEIR DAYS ONLY BY SCOUNDRELS  IF HE HAD ISSUED ONE OF THE COMPANIONS OF JEAN SBOGAR      AND  I SHUDDER TO THINK OF IT  JEANS SBOGAR HIMSELF          JEAN SBOGAR        INTERRUPTED LOTHARIO WITH THE ACCENT OF WORRY AND SURPRISE    BUT WHO COULD THINK    HE CONTINUED    THAT JEAN SBOGAR  OR EVEN ONE OF HIS FAMILY  WOULD HAVE DARED THROW IN THE MIDDLE OF VENICE  AIMLESSLY  WITHOUT KNOWN INTEREST  BECAUSE THIS IS NOT IN A BIG CITY THAT THESE BANDITS CAN EXERCISE OPENLY ROBBERY AND ASSASSINATION  THIS ARTIFICE OF MINIONS IS TOO RUDE          IT IS ABSURD    EXCLAIMED MADAME ALBERTI    WE CAN IMAGINE THAT A OUTLAWED FROM A HIGH ORDER  THAT THE LEADER OF A GENEROUS PARTY ENTER A CITY WHERE HIS JUDGMENT IS PASSED  WHERE HE IS DEVOTED TO DEATH AND AWAITED BY THE SCAFFOLD  WHEN THIS ATTEMPT WOULD BE USELESS TO HIS CAUSE  HOW MANY FEELINGS CAN THERE BE DETERMINE  BUT WHAT FEELING  WHAT PASSION WOULD DETERMINE A MISERABLE LEADER OF THIEVES  WHOSE HEART HAS NEVER BEATEN THE HOPE OF THE BOOTY  TO EXECUTE SUCH A RECKLESS ENTERPRISE  THIS IS NOT LOVE  NO DOUBT  HAPPY OR UNHAPPY IN HIS DESIGNS  ALWAYS SURE TO INSPIRE THE SAME CONTEMPT  OF WHAT WOMAN WOULD HE GET THE LOOKS  IF NOT FROM THOSE FOR WHOM WE WOULD BE ASHAMED OF DOING ANYTHING  IS THERE SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS THE LOVER OF JEAN SBOGAR      INDEED    SAID LOTHARIO    THAT WOULD BE SINGULAR     BESIDES   CONTINUED MADAME ALBERTI    WHO EVEN KNOWS IF THIS MAN EXISTS  IF HIS NAME IS NOT THE WATCHWORD OF A BAND AS CONTEMPTIBLE AS THE OTHERS  BUT CLEVER ENOUGH TO ITS BASENESS BY THE BRILLIANCE OF SOME RENOWN      ON THIS POINT  MADAME    SAID A MAN OF ADVANCED AGE  WHO HAD LISTENED ATTENTIVELY TO MADAME ALBERTI AS SHE SPOKE  AND WHO HAD BEEN POINTING OUT FOR SOME TIME THE INTENTION OF HIM ANSWER    YOUR DOUBTS ARE UNFOUNDED  JEAN SBOGAR EXISTS VERY REALLY  AND IS NOT ENTIRELY UNKNOWN TO ME      THE CIRCLE TIGHTENED  EXCEPT FOR LOTHARIO WHO CONTINUED TO PAY FAIRLY COOL ATTENTION TO THE CONVERSATION  ACCORDING TO HIS USAGE  AT MOST THAT WHICH POLITENESS REQUIRES IN AN INTERVIEW WHOSE OBJECT IS EQUALLY INDIFFERENT TO EVERYONE     I AM DALMATIAN    CONTINUED THE STRANGER    AND BORN IN SPALATO      TO SPALATO    SAID LOTHARIO  COMING CLOSER    I KNOW  VERY MUCH THIS COUNTRY      JEAN SBOGAR WAS BORN IN THE VICINITY OF THIS CITY    REPLIED THE OLD MAN    AT LEAST IF I ARE TO BELIEVE THE TESTIMONIES WHICH HAVE COME DOWN TO ME  FOR THAT VERY NAME IS NOT HIS NAME  HE TOOK IT IN LEAVING HIS FAMILY  WHICH IS ONE OF THE NOBLEST AND MOST ILLUSTRIOUS OF OUR PROVINCE  AND WHICH GOES BACK DIRECTLY TO A PRINCE OF ALBANIA  I WILL NOT TELL YOU WHAT DETERMINED HIM TO THIS APPROACH  BUT HE SPENT ALMOST A CHILD IN THE SERVICE OF THE TURKS  WHERE HE PROMPTLY ACQUIRED A GREAT MILITARY REPUTATION  THE EVENTS NOT HAVING BEEN FAVORABLE TO HIS PARTY  HE WAS OBLIGED TO FLEE IN ORDER TO AVOID PROSCRIPTION  HE RETURNED  THEY SAY  IN DALMATIA AND FOUND HIMSELF THERE DISINHERITED  ACCUSTOMED TO A STORMY LIFE  AND TORMENTED  IT SEEMS  BY DARK AND VIOLENT PASSIONS  HE SEIZES THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME ATTACHED TO A STATE OF PERMANENT REVOLUTION  IF HE HAD BEEN IN ONE OF HIS HAPPY POSITIONS WHERE ACTIVITY AND GENIUS LEAD TO EVERYTHING  IT IS WOULD PERHAPS BE ACQUIRED AN HONORABLE REPUTATION  IN THE ABSENCE OF PERILS WHICH GIVE GLORY  HE EMBRACED THOSE WHO DO NOT THAT CONTEMPT AND THE SCAFFOLD  IT IS A BEING TO BE PITIED      HAVE YOU SEEN HIM  HAVE YOU SEEN JEAN SBOGAR    SAID ANTONIA      I OFTEN HUGGED HIM WHEN HE WAS A CHILD    REPLIED THE OLD MAN    IT WAS THEN A SOFT AND TENDER SOUL  AND SUCH A NOBLE AND BEAUTIFUL FIGURE      HE WAS BEAUTIFUL    EXCLAIMED MADAME ALBERTI      WHY NOT    WHISPERED LOTHARIO    A BEAUTIFUL PHYSIOGNOMY IS THE EXPRESSION OF A BEAUTIFUL SOUL  AND THAT BEAUTIFUL SOULS HAVE BEEN ALTERED  BITTER  SOMETIMES DEGRADED BY MISFORTUNE  THAT CHILDREN WERE THE PRIDE OF THEIR MOTHERS  WHO BECAME THE SCUM OR TERROR OF THE WORLD  SATAN  THE DAY BEFORE HIS FALL  WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF ANGELS  BUT   HE CONTINUED RAISING HIS VOICE    DID YOU KNOW HIM OLDER      UNTIL TEN OR TWELVE    SAID THE OLD DALMATIAN    AND SINCE FOR SOME TIME HE HAD BECOME DREAMY AND LONELY  I STILL HAVE THOUGHT EVER SINCE I WOULD RECOGNIZE HIM IF I EVER MET HIM      GOD PRESERVE YOU    CONTINUED LOTHARIO    TO RECOGNIZE HIM ON THE BENCH OF ASSASSINS  THIS MOMENT WOULD ALSO BE AWFUL FOR YOU AND FOR HIM     FOR HIM TO WHOM HE WOULD RECALL THE MEMORIES OF A YOUTH WHOSE PROMISES HE DENIED  AND WHO MADE PERHAPS NOW HIS GREATEST TORMENT      IN TRUTH  LOTHARIO    SAID ANTONIA    YOU ARE TOO WILLING TO SENSING SIMILAR IMPRESSIONS IN OTHERS  YOU DO NOT DO NOT THINK THAT  IN JEAN SBOGAR  THEY ARE NECESSARILY ALIENATED BY THE SOLE EFFECT OF HER HABITS  AND HER LOW SOUL AND WITHERED WOULD NO LONGER UNDERSTAND THEM  WHEN IT WAS TRUE  AS IT IS SAID  THAT SHE COULD NEVER HAVE UNDERSTOOD THEM      LOTHARIO SMILES GENTLY AT ANTONIA  THEN  TURNING TO THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO MADE UP THE COMPANY  AND ADDRESSING MORE PARTICULARLY TO THE OLD MAN WHO HAD JUST SPOKEN     THAT THE GUILTY IS UNHAPPY ON EARTH    HE SAID IN SHAKING HIS HEAD    SINCE HE IS HATED BY SUCH SOULS  WITHOUT THAT THERE REMAINS BEFORE THEM A PRETEXT TO JUSTIFY HIMSELF OR TO SOFTEN THE RIGOR OF THEIR JUDGMENT  IT SEEMS TO THEM ONLY ONE MONSTER PLACED QUITE OUT OF NATURE BY ODDITY FIERCE OF ITS DESTINY  AND WHICH DOES NOT HOLD ANYTHING HUMAN  IT WAS NOT THROWN INTO THE RANKS OF THE LIVING ONLY TO FRIGHTEN THEM AND TO DIE  THIS UNFORTUNATE MAN HAD NO PARENTS  HE DID NOT COUNT ANY FRIENDS  HIS HEART NEVER BEAT FROM A DEEP FEELING OF SADNESS AT THE SIGHT OF AN UNHAPPY MAN LIKE HIM  HER TEARLESS EYE CLOSED AT THE SLEEP BESIDE THE WAKING AND CRYING MISERY  GOOD LORD  THAT SUCH A SUPPOSITION WOULD DISTURB ORDER FOR ME ALREADY IF SAD OF HUMAN SOCIETY  AH  I PREFER TO BELIEVE IN ERROR OF A FALSE JUDGMENT  TO THE BITTERNESS OF A WOUNDED HEART  TO THE REACTION OF A NOBLE  BUT PITILESS VANITY  WHICH REBELLED AGAINST ALL THAT BOTHERED HER  AND WHICH OPENED A WAY OF BLOOD AMONG MEN  TO MAKE THEMSELVES KNOWN AS THEY PASS AND TO LEAVE A MARK      I THOUGHT SO   SAID ANTONIA MOVED  COMING CLOSER TO LOTHARIO AND RESTING HIS HAND ON HIS SHOULDER     ANTONIA S THOUGHT   HE CONTINUED   IS ALWAYS A REVELATION FROM HEAVEN  AS FOR ME  I UNDERSTOOD WELL  I FELT OFTEN HOW BITTER THE MISERIES OF SOCIETY COULD TO GRIEVE AN ENERGETIC SOUL  I UNDERSTAND THE RAVAGES THAT THE PASSION OF WELL EVEN WOULD SOMETIMES PRODUCE IN A FIERY HEART AND INCONSIDERATE  THERE ARE MEN WHO ARE TURBULENT BY CALCULATION  STORMY BY INTEREST  WHOSE HYPOCRITICAL EXALTATION WILL NEVER SURPRISE NEITHER MY SPIRIT NOR MY PITY  BUT  AS LONG AS I FIND LOYALTY UNDER ONE RECKLESS  EXTRAVAGANT OR FEROCIOUS ACTION  I AM QUITE READY TO MAKE THE SECOND OF THE MAN WHO COMMITTED IT  JUSTICE HAD IT ALREADY CONDEMNED      ANTONIA WITHDREW HER HAND WITH A SORT OF DREAD  LOTHARIO THE GRABBED     MAN BELONGED TO TWO VERY DIFFERENT STATES  BUT HE IN THE SECOND WON SOME MEMORIES OF THE FIRST  AND EVERY ONCE A GREAT POLITICAL UPHEAVAL TILTS TOWARDS HIS STATE THE BALANCE OF SOCIETY  HE RUSHES INTO IT WITH A INCREDIBLE ARDOR  BECAUSE THIS IS THE TENDENCY OF HIS ORGANIZATION  WHICH ALWAYS BRINGS HIM BACK FROM AN IRRESISTIBLE AUTHORITY TO THE MOST COMPLETE ENJOYMENT OF FREEDOM THAT CAN BE PROCURE  THIS FEELING CAN BE DREADFUL IN ITS RESULTS  HE IS ALMOST ALWAYS ABSURD IN HIS COMBINATIONS  BUT HE HOLDS TO THE NATURE OF MAN  AND HE IS IN HIMSELF NOBLE AND TOUCHING  IT IS MUCH MORE STILL IN A WORN OUT SOCIETY LIKE THOSE AMONG WHERE WE LIVE  AND WHERE ALL THE POWER  SHARED FOR A FEW MOMENTS BETWEEN EQUALLY PRECARIOUS INSTITUTIONS WHICH ONLY HAVE THE RIGHT TO TIME OR WHO STILL ONLY HAVE THAT OF DARING  THREATENS TO FALL AT ANY TIME FROM THE HANDS OF RECKLESSNESS IN THOSE OF BASENESS  AND TO BECOME THE SHARING OF THE LAST MISERABLE     WHAT  WHEN A PEOPLE HAVE REACHED THIS POINT  WHEN  TORN FROM ITS ANCIENT CUSTOMS AND ITS ANCIENT LAWS BY A INVINCIBLE FORCE  AND UNCERTAIN OF HIS EXISTENCE  HE PUTS HIS COWARDLY AGONY IN THE ARMS OF THE HYPOCRITICAL JUGGLERS WHO CARESS TO INHERIT HIS LAST REMAINS  WHEN THE SOCIETY  SO CLOSE TO ITS RUIN  HARDLY RESTS AMONG THE WICKED THAN ON INTERESTS  AMONG DECENT PEOPLE ONLY ON SOME MORAL RULES THAT WILL CEASE TO EXIST  IT WILL BE FORBIDDEN TO THE STRONG MAN WHO FINDS IN HIM  AND IN THE IMPULSE THAT HE IS ABLE TO GIVE TO OTHERS THE GUARANTEE  THE ONLY GUARANTEE OF THE RIGHTS OF THE ENTIRE SPECIES      HE WILL BE PROHIBITED FROM TO GATHER ALL HIS FACULTIES AGAINST THE ASCENDANCY OF THE DESTRUCTION  AGAINST THE PROGRESS OF DEATH  I KNOW WELL THAT THIS MAN WILL NOT FLY THE STANDARD OF ORDINARY SOCIETIES  THE ORDINARY SOCIETIES WOULD REPEL HIM  FOR HE WOULD SPEAK TO THEM A LANGUAGE WHICH THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND AND WHICH IS FORBIDDEN TO THEM TO HEAR  TO SERVE THEM  HE MUST SEPARATE HIMSELF FROM THEM  AND THE WAR THAT HE DECLARES TO THEM IS THE FIRST GUARANTEE OF THE INDEPENDENCE THAT THEY WILL ONE DAY FIND UNDER ITS AUSPICES  WHEN THE HAND WHICH MAINTAINS THE STATES HAS WITHDRAWN ALTOGETHER  SO THESE DESPICABLE BRIGANDS  THE OBJECT OF DISGUST AND HORROR NATIONS  WILL BECOME ITS ARBITERS  AND THEIR SCAFFOLDS WILL WILL CHANGE INTO ALTARS     THIS IS NOT A PARADOX HERE    CONTINUED LOTHARIO    IT IS A INDUCTION DRAWN FROM THE HISTORY OF PEOPLES  AND WHICH IS BASED ON THE EXAMPLE OF ALL CENTURIES  WHO WOULD NOT SEE A VERY NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS IN THIS SPIRIT OF RENEWAL WHICH MANIFESTS ITSELF AT THE END OF A CIVILIZATION  AND WHICH KILLS IT FOR TO REJUVENATE IT  BECAUSE AFTER ALL NATIONS ONLY REJUVENATE IN THIS WAY  LESS IF EXPERIENCE IS TO BE BELIEVED  AND YOU BELIEVE IN THE PROVIDENCE  AND YOU DARE TO BLAME ITS MEANS  WHEN A VOLCANO PURIFIES THE EARTH BY COVERING YOUR COUNTRYSIDE WITH STEAMING LAVA  YOU SAY THAT GOD WILLED IT  AND YOU DO NOT BELIEVE THAT GOD HAS CLOTHED SPECIAL MISSION THESE MEN OF BLOOD AND TERROR WHO WEAR OUT  WHO BREAK THE SPRINGS OF THE SOCIAL STATE TO START IT ALL OVER AGAIN  SEARCH YOUR MEMORY FOR THE FOUNDERS OF THE COMPANIES NEWS  AND YOU WILL SEE THAT THESE MEN ARE ROBBERS LIKE THOSE YOU CONDEMN  WHAT WERE  I ASK YOU  THESE THESEUS  THESE PIRITHO S  THESE ROMULUS WHO MARKED THE PASSAGE OF BARBARIAN AGES TO THE HEROIC AGE OVER WHICH THEY PRESIDED  HERCULES HIMSELF WHOSE NAME HAS BEEN REVERED AMONG THE WEAK  BECAUSE THE STRONG NEVER HAD A MORE FORMIDABLE ENEMY  AND WHOSE ANGER WAS DIRECTED ONLY AT KINGS AND GODS  THE PRIESTS CONSECRATED THE MEMORY OF HIS LABORS  AND HE AWARDED THE APOTHEOSIS  ALTHOUGH HE WAS BASTARD  THIEF  MURDERER AND SUICIDE  I SAW  IN MY TRIP TO ATHENS  THE MOUNTAIN ON WHICH MARS WAS PUT ON TRIAL FOR ASSASSINATION      WHILE LOTHARIO SPOKE  ANTONIA SAT DOWN  AND THE WATCHED WITH AN INDEFINABLE FEELING  MADAME ALBERTI WAS TAKING A LESS LIVELY PART IN HER SPEECHES  BUT SHE ENJOYED THEM AS OF A SINGULAR AND NEW IDEA  AND SUCH WAS THE EMPIRE OVER HER OF THESE IDEAS  WHICH HE OFTEN MADE HIM FORGET HOW MUCH THEY WERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE FEELINGS SHE HAD RECEIVED FROM HIS EDUCATION  OR THAT HIS OWN REASON HAD INSPIRED HIM    THE CHARACTER OF LOTHARIO  KNOWN MOREOVER BY AN INDEPENDENCE A NOT VERY SHY  AND BY A MARKED INCLINATION FOR OPINIONS WHICH DO NOT DID NOT BEAR THE SEAL OF POWER AND MORE SHAMEFUL APPROVAL STILL OF THE MULTITUDE  LENT AN INTEREST TO HIS EXPRESSIONS SPICY AND SINGULAR  HIS POSITION IN THE WORLD WAS SUCH THAT COULD NOT SEE IN HIS MOST BIZARRE AND THE MOST CHANCE THAT A WHIM OF HIS IMAGINATION  THIS IMPRESSION WAS SO GENERAL WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN THAT IT WAS RARE THAT WE TRIED TO CONTRADICT HIM  WE WERE GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR THE OUTPOURING OF HIS HEART  THE ABANDONMENT OF HIS MOVEMENTS  HE WAS NOT ASKED TO ACCOUNT FOR IT  THIS CONVERSATION WAS LONG OVER  AND LOTHARIO  ABSORBED  NO LONGER TOOK PART IN THE INDIFFERENT CONVERSATION  THE COLD EXCHANGE OF INSIGNIFICANT SENTENCES THAT HAD SUCCEEDED IT  THE HEAD RESTING ON HIS HAND  HE FIXED A DARK EYE ON ANTONIA  WHO HAD CHANGED PLACES WITHOUT NOTICING IT TO GET CLOSER OF HIM  AND WHO SEEMED STRUCK BY A PAINFUL THOUGHT     LOTHARIO    SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE  HOLDING OUT HER HAND   YOUR LOVE FOR THE WEAK AND THE UNFORTUNATE CARRIES YOU AWAY SOMETIMES TO SAY THINGS THAT YOU WOULDN T APPROVE OF AFTER HAVING THOUGHT ABOUT IT  BEWARE OF ENTHUSIASM THAT CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES COULD MAKE IT DISASTROUS FOR YOUR HAPPINESS  HAPPINESS OF THOSE WHO LOVE YOU      FROM THOSE WHO LOVE ME    EXCLAIMED LOTHARIO       AH  IF I WAS LOVE  IF I COULD HAVE BEEN  IF THE WORLD HAD BEEN KNOWN TO ME  IF THE GAZE OF A WOMAN WORTHY OF MY HEART HAD FALLEN ON MY HEART BEFORE MISFORTUNE HAD WITHERED HIM      HOW STRANGE GUESS          ANTONIA HAD COME CLOSER TO ISOLATE LOTHARIO  OR TO HEAR IT BETTER  HIS HAND WAS CROSSED IN HIS     YES    RESUMED LOTHARIO    IF A WOMAN INTENDED FOR ME HAD ALLOWED MY MISERABLE LIFE A FEELING THAT RESEMBLED LOVE  IF A BEING WHO HAD APPROACHED ANTONIA  WHO HAD APPROACHED FROM AFAR LIKE THE SHADOW OF REALITY  HAD TAKEN ME THEN UNDER THE PROTECTION OF HIS PITY      IF I COULD HAVE BREATHED WITHOUT DESECRATION THE AIR AGITATED BY THE FOLDS OF HER DRESS  OR THE WAVES OF HER HAIR     IF MY LIPS HAD DARED TO TELL YOU  ANTONIA  I LOVE YOU         SOCIETY WAS FLOWING  ANTONIA  TREMBLING  HAD STOPPED UNDERSTAND ITS POSITION  SHE REMAINED MOTIONLESS  AND MADAME ALBERTI HAD RETURNED  BUT LOTHARIO HADN T CHANGED HIS LANGUAGE  HE REPEATED HIS LAST SENTENCE WITH A DARKER EXPRESSION  AND DREW MADAME ALBERTI TOWARDS HER SISTER WITH A CRY OF PAIN     WHAT ARE YOU DOING    HE SAID    WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH LOTHARIO  DO YOU KNOW LOTHARIO  OR RATHER THIS STRANGER  THIS MAN FROM CHANCE WHICH HAS NO NAME  AND YOU  THE SISTER OF THIS CHILD  DO YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE HER  AND THAT MY LOVE KILLS      ANTONIA SMILED BITTERLY    THIS CONNECTION OF IDEAS DID NOT MAKE ITSELF FELT IN HIS MIND  BUT SHE SAW IN IT A PAINFUL OMEN    MADAME ALBERTI WAS NOT SURPRISED  THESE EXPRESSIONS WERE NOT FOR HER THAN THAT OF EXALTED LOVE  AS LOTHARIO MUST HAVE FELT  AND AS SHE HAD OFTEN IMAGINED IT  SHE SQUEEZED HIS HAND OF LOTHARIO  LOOKING AT HIM IN A LOVING WAY  FOR HIM TESTIFY THAT IT DEPENDED ON HIM TO BE HAPPY  AND THAT HE WOULD FIND NO OBSTACLE TO HIS WISHES IN THE ONE PERSON WHO COULD STILL EXERCISE SOME SWAY OVER HER SISTER S RESOLUTIONS  ANTONIA S FEELINGS  ENCOURAGED BY THIS ADMISSION  ARE DEMONSTRATED WITH MORE ABANDON  SHE PAINTED THEM WITH A LOOK  THE FIRST LOOK IN HER EYES THAT LOVE WOULD HAVE ANIMATED     WOE TO ME  SAID LOTHARIO IN A MUFFLED VOICE  AND HE DISAPPEARED    THE SOUND OF AN OAR HITTING THE CANAL DISTURBED THE DREARY SILENCE THAT HAD FOLLOWED HIS DEPARTURE  ANTONIA RUSHED TO THE WINDOW  THE THE MOON LIT UP LOTHARIO S FLOATING PLUME WITH ONE OF ITS RAYS  WHO WAS DRESSED IN THE VENETIAN STYLE THAT DAY  THE APPEARANCE OF THE SKY  THE MOVEMENT OF THE AIR  THE HOUR  THE INSTANT  SOME OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE PERHAPS  ANTONIA REMINDED US  THE APPEARANCE OF THIS BRIGAND UNKNOWN SHE HAD SEEN LEAVING THE PIER OF SAINT CHARLES  HIS HEART GAVE ONLY A MOMENT TO THIS MEMORY OF TERROR  WHATEVER THE MOTIVE SECRET OF LOTHARIO S TROUBLE  HE HAD TOLD HER THAT HE LOVED HER  AND HIS TENDERNESS WAS TO PROTECT HER AGAINST ALL PERILS      XII   AH  DELICIOUS LAND  IF THERE WAS SOME STAY SUITABLE FOR TO CALM THE SORROWS OF A SORRY HEART A LITTLE  TO HEAL THE WOUNDS PROFOUND EFFECTS MADE BY THE FEATURES OF SORROW  AND TO RECALL THE FIRST ILLUSIONS OF LIFE  IT WOULD PROBABLY BE YOU WHO WOULD OFFER IT  YOUR ENCHANTING APPEARANCE  YOUR LONELY WOODS  YOUR AIR PURE AND BALSAMIC HAVE THE POWER TO CALM ALL KINDS OF SADNESS     OUT OF DESPAIR   CHARLOTTE SMITH    MADAME ALBERTI SPENT THE NIGHT AND PART OF THE FOLLOWING DAY AT LOOK FOR INTERPRETATIONS OF LOTHARIO S MYSTERIOUS SPEECHES  SHE DID NOT FIND ANY WHICH CHANGED THE SLIGHTEST THING IN HER PROVISIONS  A PERHAPS OBSCURE BIRTH  A FORTUNE PERHAPS DISTURBED BY EXCESSIVE LAVISHNESS  GREAT POLITICAL OR PRIVATE MISFORTUNES THAT KEPT HIM FOREVER DISTANT OF HIS HOMELAND  SUCH WERE THE VARIOUS WHICH HIS IMAGINATION STOPPED  AND NONE OF THEM GAVE BIRTH TO THE IDEA OF   A WELL FOUNDED OBSTACLE TO ANTONIA S HAPPINESS  THE LOTHARIO S VERY RESISTANCE WAS THEN EXPLAINED BY FEELINGS SO DELICATE AND SO HONORABLE THAT SHE DID NOT HESITATE ON THE MEANS TRIUMPH OVER IT    AFTER A FEW MOMENTS OF CONVERSATION WITH ANTONIA  SHE ALLOWED HIM TO TO DISPOSE OF HIS HAND IN FAVOR OF LOTHARIO  AND TO GIVE HIM NEWS HERSELF  CONVINCED THAT HER GENEROUS SCRUPLES WOULD NOT RESIST LOVE  ANTONIA  MORE FEARFUL AND THREATENED BY DARK FEELINGS SHE HAD KEPT USED TO SINCE CHILDHOOD  NEVER TO TASTE THE HAPPINESS THAT PRESENTED THE IMAGES  WAITED WITH MORE ANXIOUS IMPATIENCE MAY THAT DAY HAVE PASSED  IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT LOTHARIO DID NOT WOULD NOT RETURN  THAT SHE HAD SEEN HIM FOR THE LAST TIME    HE RETURNED  HOWEVER    HIS SAD AND TIRED PHYSIOGNOMY ANNOUNCED MEDITATIONS PAINFUL  HER COMPLEXION WAS LEADEN  HIS EYE HAD LOST THE SWEETNESS ORDINARY OF ITS EXPRESSION  HE PAINTED THE WORRIED VAGUE AND STORMY OF A SICK IMAGINATION  HE SAT DOWN NEXT TO ANTONIA AND STARED FIXEDLY  MADAME ALBERTI WAS BUSY AT SOME DISTANCE AND DELIBERATELY AVOIDED THEIR CONVERSATION  THIS SITUATION HAD SOMETHING DIFFICULT FOR THE SHY ORGANIZATION AND WEAK OF ANTONIA  SHE WAS TRYING TO SMILE  AND A TEAR WAS ROLLING IN HIS EYES  HER HEART WAS BEATING WITH GREAT VIOLENCE  SOMETIMES SHE TURNED AWAY FROM LOTHARIO  AND THEN SHE WAS ASTONISHED  COMING BACK TO HIMSELF  TO FIND HIM IN THIS MOTIONLESS AND SINISTER CONTEMPLATION WHERE SHE HAD LEFT IT  SHE WANTED TO SAY A FEW WORDS  BUT SHE BARELY STAMMERED CONFUSED SOUNDS  AND LOTHARIO DID NOT INQUIRE INTO WHAT SHE HAD MEANT  THE CARE WITH WHICH HE COVERED HER WITH HIS GAZE HAD SOMETHING OF A PRESTIGE AND A NIGHT VISION  FINALLY SHE MANAGED TO BREAK PART OF THAT SPELL  TELLING HIM    SO YOU ARE UNHAPPY  LOTHARIO         THIS QUESTION WAS LINKED  BY AN IMPERCEPTIBLE RELATION  TO THEIR LAST INTERVIEW  BUT IT WAS RATHER THE EXPRESSION OF A PAINFUL FEELING THAT RESULTED FROM WHAT SHE WAS EXPERIENCING THEN  THAN A TRANSITION PREPARED FOR WHAT SHE HAD PROMISED TO SAY    LOTHARIO DID NOT ANSWER     HOWEVER    SHE CONTINUED    YOU WOULD BE TOO CRUEL TO THOSE WHO LOVE YOU         THOSE WHO LOVE ME    SAID LOTHARIO  COVERING HIS HEAD WITH HIS HANDS    ALWAYS THOSE WHO LOVE ME  MY BAD ANGEL GOT YOU TAUGHT THERE A MAGIC PHRASE THAT GRIEVES MY SOUL      I WAS COMING BACK TO IT ON PURPOSE    REPLIED ANTONIA    BECAUSE I DON T KNOW NO ABSOLUTE WOE FOR THE MAN WHO IS LOVED  AND IF SO YOUR FATE  LOTHARIO  THAT MANY AFFECTIONS HAVE DECEIVED YOUR TENDERNESS  THAT MANY CONGRATULATIONS HAVE ESCAPED YOUR HOPES  IT WAS NEVER SO MUCH  MY FRIEND  THAT YOU HAVE NO LONGER FOUND WITH YOU THIS PRECIOUS COMPENSATION WHICH COMPENSATES A SENSITIVE HEART FOR ALL PAIN  YOU KNOW IT  LOTHARIO  YOU ARE LOVED      LOTHARIO LOOKED AT ANTONIA AGAIN  BUT THE CHARACTER OF HIS PHYSIOGNOMY WAS QUITE CHANGED  NO ONE NOTICED IN HIM THAN A MIXTURE OF UNEASY JOY  ASTONISHMENT AND TERROR WHICH DID NOT BELONG TO HIS FEATURES     LOTHARIO    SHE CONTINUED    I DON T KNOW YOUR FAMILY  NEITHER YOUR RANK NOR YOUR FORTUNE  AND IT MATTERS LITTLE TO ME TO KNOW ALL OF THIS  BUT I WAS TOLD THAT THE HAND OF THIS ANTONIA WHICH YOU DESIRE TO OCCUPY THE HEART WAS NOT TO BE DESPISED BY ANYONE  UNDER NONE OF THESE REPORTS  AND ANTONIA  FREE OF HER CHOICE  WOULD STOP THAT ON YOU      ON ME  LOTHARIO CRIED WITH A SORT OF FURY    MADAME ALBERTI APPROACHED      ON ME  AND IT S YOU  IT S ANTONIA WHO OVERWHELMS ME WITH A SO BITTER MOCKERY      LOTHARIO    REPLIED ANTONIA IN A TONE OF COLD DIGNITY    YOU DESPISE ANTONIA  OR YOU DIDN T UNDERSTAND HER      DESPISE ANTONIA  WHAT DOES THIS LANGUAGE MEAN  WHAT DO I HAVE SPEAK  OF A MARRIAGE  IF I M NOT MISTAKEN  AND IT S YOU         ANTONIA LEANED ON HER SISTER  SHE CRIED     MY DAUGHTER    SAID MADAME ALBERTI    RESPECT HER SECRETS  HE DOESN T WOULD REPEL POINT IF AN INVINCIBLE OBSTACLE  ANOTHER LINK PERHAPS        LOTHARIO INTERRUPTED HIM     AH  BE CAREFUL NOT TO BELIEVE IT  BORN TO LOVE ANTONIA  AND FOR TO LOVE ONLY HER  I DID NOT COMMIT MY FREEDOM TO ANY OTHER AFFECTION     AND IF HIS HAND COULD BE THE PRICE OF LOVE   OR COURAGE  IT IS TO ME  I SWEAR  THAT IT WOULD BELONG  BUT OF WHAT RIGHT AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS  UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS  BIG GOD  AND WHAT MAN WOULD DARE TO PROPOSE THEM  VENGEANCE FROM HEAVEN  THAT YOU ARE FORMIDABLE  LISTEN TO ME  HAVEN T YOU HEARD    HAVEN T WE SPOKEN TO YOU   A LITTLE WHILE AGO OF A MAN WHO IS CALLED   LOTHARIO   THAT MUST BE HIS NAME  AND THE WIFE OF LOTHARIO  IN WHICH PALACE  DO YOU KNOW  IN WHICH AREAS HE WOULD PRESENT HER TO HER VASSALS      ANTONIA SAT DOWN  A DEADLY SHUDDER FROZE HIS LIMBS  GLIMMERS HORRIBLE APPEARED TO HIS MIND WHICH REBELLED AGAINST THEY  SHE SOUGHT TO PENETRATE THIS IMPENETRABLE MYSTERY  AND ALL WHAT SHE COULD MAKE OUT WAS THAT IT WAS DEEP AND AWFUL  LOTHARIO MOVED AWAY  APPROACHED HER IN TURN  SOMETIMES HIS FEATURES BORE THE IMPRINT OF DELIRIUM  SOMETIMES THEY SEEMED TO RELAX AND DECOMPOSE UNDER A IRRESISTIBLE FORCE  FOR SOME TIME HE HAD BEEN PENSIVE AND BEATEN DOWN  SUDDENLY HER FOREHEAD CLEARED  HER EYES CAME ALIVE  A SUDDEN IDEA WHICH RECONCILED HIM WITH HOPE BURST UPON HIS PHYSIOGNOMY  HE FELL TO ANTONIA S KNEES  AND PRESSING WITH TRANSPORT HIS HANDS AND THOSE OF MADAME ALBERTI BY BATHING THEM TEARS     IF  HOWEVER    HE SAID    I HAD BEEN THE WORLD FOR HER AND FOR YOU      THE WORLD    ANSWERED ANTONIA      SHE AND YOU    CONTINUED MADAME ALBERTI    ALL MY LIFE WAS IN THAT THOUGHT      IT WOULD BE TRUE    CRIED LOTHARIO  AS IF OVERWHELMED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF A HAPPINESS HE HAD NEVER EXPECTED    IT WOULD BE TRUE  AND I COULD START A NEW EXISTENCE WITH YOU  TAKE MY NAME AND MY DESTINY AMONG MEN   I COULD  BUT MUST     HOW DARE I SUBMIT WHAT I LOVE     SO THE WANT MY FATAL STAR  IT S FAR FROM HERE  FAR FROM THE CITIES  IN A A COUNTRY WHERE YOU WOULD NEEDLESSLY ENJOY THE SHINE OF A GREAT NAME AND OF GREAT FORTUNE    BUT WHERE NOW I WOULD DEVOTE MY LIFE WHOLE     AH  LET ME REST A WHILE UNDER THE FEELINGS THAT OPPRESS ME      LOTHARIO WAS SILENT FOR A FEW MINUTES  THEN HE ROSE  AND  RESUMING HIS SPEECH WITH MORE CALM  HE SPOKE SO     WHILE STILL YOUNG  I ALREADY FELT WITH BITTERNESS THE EVILS OF SOCIETY  WHO HAVE ALWAYS REBELLED MY SOUL  WHO HAVE SOMETIMES DRAWN INTO EXCESSES THAT ANTONIA REPROACHED ME WITH YESTERDAY  AND WHICH I HAVE EXPIATED ALL TOO PAINFULLY  BY INSTINCT RATHER THAN BY RIGHT  I FLED THE CITIES AND THE PEOPLE WHO INHABIT THEM  BECAUSE I HATED THEM  NOT KNOWING HOW MUCH ONE DAY I MUST HATE THEM  THE MOUNTAINS OF CARNIOLA  THE FORESTS OF CROATIA  THE STRIKES WILD AND ALMOST UNINHABITED POOR DALMATIANS  STARED IN TURN MY RACE WORRIES  I STAYED LITTLE IN THE PLACES WHERE THE EMPIRE OF SOCIETY HAD GROWN  AND STILL MOVING BACK IN FRONT OF HIS PROGRESS WHICH INDIGNANT THE INDEPENDENCE OF MY HEART  I ALL I WANTED WAS TO ESCAPE IT ENTIRELY  THERE IS A POINT OF THESE COUNTRIES  COMMON LANDMARK OF MODERN CIVILIZATION AND OF AN ANCIENT CIVILIZATION WHICH LEFT DEEP TRACES  THE CORRUPTION AND SLAVERY  MONTENEGRO IS AS IF PLACED IN BORDERS OF TWO WORLDS  AND I DO NOT KNOW WHAT VAGUE TRADITION HAD GIVEN ME REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS NOT PART OF EITHER THE OTHER  IT IS A EUROPEAN OASIS  ISOLATED BY ROCKS INACCESSIBLE  AND BY SPECIAL CUSTOMS THAT CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLES DID NOT CORRUPT  I KNEW THE LANGUAGE OF MONTENEGRINS  I HAD SPOKEN TO A FEW OF THEM  WHEN NEEDS THAT NEVER INCREASE  AND THAT NEVER CHANGE NEVER OF NATURE  HAD BROUGHT BY CHANCE IN OUR CITIES  I HAD A SWEET IDEA OF   THE LIFE OF THESE SAVAGES WHO HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT FOR SO MANY CENTURIES  AND WHICH  FOR SO MANY CENTURIES  HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCE BY CAREFULLY DEFENDING THEMSELVES OF THE APPROACH OF CIVILIZED MEN  INDEED  THEIR SITUATION IS SUCH THAT NO INTEREST  NO AMBITION CAN CALL IN THEIR DESERTS THIS TROOP OF GREEDY BRIGANDS WHO INVADE THE EARTH TO EXPLOIT IT  THE CURIOUS ALONE AND THE LEARNED HAVE SOMETIMES ATTEMPTED ACCESS TO THESE SOLITUDES  AND THEY FOUND THE DEATH THEY WERE GOING TO CARRY THERE  BECAUSE THE PRESENCE OF THE SOCIAL MAN IS MORTAL TO A FREE PEOPLE WHO ENJOY THE PURITY OF THEIR FEELINGS NATURAL  IT WAS THEREFORE DIFFICULT TO ENTER  I SUCCEEDED HOWEVER  THANKS TO CLOTHING SIMILAR TO THEIRS AND USED TO THEIR LANGUAGE  BESIDES  THEY WERE NOT MEN THAT I WAS GOING TO LOOK FOR  IT WAS AN INDEPENDENT LAND WHERE NEVER HEARD THE VOICE OF A HUMAN POWER FOUNDED ON OTHERS RIGHTS AS PATERNITY  I HAD MEASURED MY NEEDS  THOSE OF A A FIERY HEADED ADOLESCENT  WHO ALWAYS BELIEVES HIMSELF TO BE SUFFICIENT  BECAUSE THAT  IN SOME MOMENT OF BITTER INTOXICATION  HE THOUGHT HE FELT THAT ALL AILMENTS ARE INSUFFICIENT FOR HIS HEART  AND THAT GOD MADE HIM ALONE OF HIS KIND  I DIDN T NEED MY AMBITION THAN A CABIN AGAINST THE HARSH COLD OF WINTER  A TREE FRUIT TREE AND A FOUNTAIN  I WANDERED FOR A LONG TIME ON THE ONLY TRACE OF WILD BEASTS  THROUGH THE VARIED GROUPS OF THE MOUNTAINS CLEMENTINES  FLEEING FROM AFAR THE SMOKE OF MAN S HOUSES  IN WHICH A FEELING THAT THE MONTENEGRINS HAVE RECIPROCALLY MADE ME SEE AN ENEMY EVERYWHERE     I WILL NOT PAINT YOU THE STRONG IMPRESSIONS THAT I RECEIVED OF THAT GREAT AND IMPOSING NATURE THAT HAS NEVER BEEN SUBDUED  AND WHOSE BENEFITS ARE SUFFICIENT FOR A POPULATION FORTUNATELY ENOUGH RARE TO BE EXEMPTED FROM SOLICITING THEM  I WON T TELL YOU WITH WHAT JOY I STOLE A NOURISHING ROOT FROM THE EARTH  WITHOUT FEAR OF HARMING THE GREED OF A GREEDY FARMER  OR TO DECEIVE THE HOPE OF A FAMILY OF STARVING LABORERS  AND TO HEAR THIS FATAL WORD RESOUND WHICH ALWAYS REMINDS ME  AS ONE OF YOUR WRITERS  THE USURPATION OF THE LAND  THIS IS MY FIELD   ONE DAY AT LAST  HOW WILL I EXPRESS THE INEXPLICABLE MIXTURE OF FEELINGS WHICH FOLLOWED ONE ANOTHER IN ME  THE SUN WAS SETTING IN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SEASON OF THE YEAR  HE LAY DOWN AT THE END OF AN IMMENSE VALLEY SHADED ON ALL SIDES BY GROVES FIG TREES  POMEGRANATE TREES AND OLEANDERS  AND THAT COVERED  FROM TIME TO TIME  SMALL ISOLATED HOUSES  BUT SURROUNDED BY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL  THE HAPPIEST CULTURES  IT IS A PAINTING THAT BELONGED  IT IS TRUE  TO THE STATE OF SOCIETY  BUT TO THE SOCIETY OF THE FIRST AGE  IN NO TIME  IN ANY PLACE  THE FARMER S HOUSE HAD FLATTERED MY EYES IN ONE ASPECT MORE AGREABLE  NEVER HAD MY IMAGINATION DREAMED SO MUCH PROSPERITY FOR THE VILLAGER S HOME  I THEN DESIGNED THE REPORTS FULL OF CHARMS OF THE MAN LOVED BY MAN  AND USEFUL TO HIS HAPPINESS WITHOUT BEING NECESSARY TO HIM  IN AN AGRICULTURAL TRIBE  I REGRETTED NOT HAVING LIVED WHEN CIVILIZATION WAS THAT AT THIS POINT  OR NOT TO BE ALLOWED TO ENJOY IT IN THE PEOPLE WHO TASTED ITS SWEETNESS  SOON I SHUDDER TO THINK  REMINDING ME THAT THE LAWS OF SUCH A SOCIETY SHOULD BE TERRIBLE  AND THAT THE STRANGER WHO DEFILED THE TERRITORY COULD WAIT UNTIL DEATH  MY BLOOD WAS BOILING WITH INDIGNATION AGAINST MYSELF AT THE MOMENT WHEN  IN THE VEINS OF ANOTHER  HE WOULD BE FROZEN WITH TERROR    AH  WOE TO THE LAYMAN  I CRIED  WHICH WOULD BRING HERE THE VICES AND FALSE SCIENCES OF EUROPE  IF I HAD A MOTHER  A SISTER OR A MISTRESS  HE WOULD PAY DEARLY THE INSULT HE HAS DONE TO THE AIR I BREATHE BY POISONING HIM WITH HIS BREATH       A MONTENEGRIN HEARD ME  BECAUSE I HAD EXPRESSED MYSELF IN HIS LANGUAGE       THESE ARE ALSO OUR LAWS    HE SAID TO ME  TAKING MY HAND   AND THOSE WHO LIKE YOU GO DOWN TO OUR VALLEYS HEIGHTS OF MONTEN GRE  WHOSE EXTERNAL BARRIERS ARE ALMOST INSURMOUNTABLE TO FOREIGNERS  ARE NOT ALWAYS ADMITTED TO LIVE AMONG MERITED SHEPHERDS  THE DIFFERENCE IN OUR CUSTOMS SEPARATE ENOUGH  SINCE YOU ARE HUNTERS AND WARRIORS  AND THAT YOU WOULD HARDLY AGREE TO SHARE THE SWEET HABITS AND THE QUIET LIFE OF OUR PASTORS  ONLY  NOT TO NOT TO HINDER THE NATURAL FREEDOM OF MEN  BY ABUSING THE POWER THAT WE EXERCISE ON OUR CHILDREN  WE SOMETIMES ALLOW THE EXCHANGE OF THOSE WHOM THEIR INCLINATION CALLS TO DEFEND OUR MOUNTAINS  AGAINST THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE SIMPLER TASTES MAKE AMBITION THE PEACEFUL WORKS OF OUR FIELDS  AND THIS FREE TRADE IN MEN AND FEELINGS MAINTAINS OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR NEIGHBORS  DESPITE THE DIFFERENCE IN OUR CUSTOMS  SO SINCE CENTURIES  THE WARLIKE MONTENEGRINS ENVELOP OUR MOUNTAINS WITH A BELT OF FORMIDABLE MEN  AND PROTECT THESE FIELDS  WHICH FEED THEM IN TURN  WHEN NATURE REFUSES TO PROVIDE THEIR NEEDS  WHICH RARELY HAPPENS  YOU ARE PROBABLY A CHILDREN OF OUR BROTHERS  AND ALL THIS GREAT SPACE    HE CONTINUED  POINTING TO AN ISOLATED CORNER OF THE VALLEY  DELICIOUS IN APPEARANCE  AND ALREADY COVERED WITH THE HOPES OF RICH HARVEST   IT ALL BELONGS TO YOU  WHOEVER YOU ARE  YES YOU CHOOSE A BRIDE FROM AMONG OUR DAUGHTERS  IF SHE GIVES YOU CHILDREN  AND YOUR DOMAIN IS NO LONGER ENOUGH FOR YOU  WE WILL ENLARGE IT DUE TO YOUR NEED  EXCEPT TO MAKE IN PROPORTION TO NATURE WHAT YOU CAN DO WITHOUT WHEN YOUR FAMILY WILL HAVE SPREAD OUT IN OUR MOUNTAINS  BECAUSE AT OTHER PEOPLES ARE JUDGED BY THE PROSPERITY OF FAMILIES AND VILLAGES TO THE EXTENT OF CULTURES  AND HERE WE MEASURE IT ON THE EXTENT OF LAND THAT REMAINS FALLOW  AND WHOSE NEEDS EARLY  SIGNS OF A TOO LARGE POPULATION  DID NOT MAKE THE NECESSARY OPERATION  FROM THIS MOMENT YOU ARE PASTOR DESERVES  YOU ARE FREE  AND THERE IS BETWEEN YOU AND WE HAVE NO OBLIGATION OTHER THAN THAT OF MUTUAL AID AND HOSPITALITY  ON THE RARE OCCASIONS WHEN SOME EVENT UNEXPECTEDLY MAY MAKE THEM NECESSARY  IF YOU DON T HAVE ANY NEEDS CURRENT  GO AND TAKE POSSESSION OF YOUR DOMAIN  OTHER  TURN TO US  AND NOTHING WILL MISS YOU THAT NATURE GRANT TO THE DESIRES OF A SIMPLE MAN      AS HE FINISHED THESE WORDS  HE WAS PREPARING TO LEAVE ME  BUT A UNBEARABLE IDEA CORRUPTED MY HAPPINESS AND MADE ME INCAPABLE TO ENJOY IT  IT WAS A PART OF MY LIFE TO MAKE MYSELF KNOWN  BUT SOMETHING MORE COMPELLING THAN THE BEST INTERESTS OF MY LIFE FORBADE TO RECEIVE THE HOSPITABLE KINDNESS OF THESE MOUNTAIN PEOPLE A BLESSING THAT WAS NOT INTENDED FOR ME    MY BROTHER   I SAID TO HIM   YOU ARE DECEIVED BY APPEARANCES  I WAS BORN OUTSIDE THE CLEMENTINE MOUNTAINS  I LOOKED THERE FREEDOM  EVERYTHING PROVES TO ME THAT I WOULD HAVE FOUND THERE THE ONLY GOODS THAT I DESIRE ON EARTH THE FREE ENJOYMENT OF THE AIR  THE SKY AND FROM MY HEART   BUT THIS PARADISE THAT YOU OFFER ME BELONGS TO A MAN HAPPIER THAN ME  I AM ONLY IN THIS GROVE STRANGER WHOM YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO PUNISH      LE MORLAQUE LOOKED AT ME     YOUNG MAN   HE SAID AFTER A MOMENT OF SILENCE   WE DON T KNOW NOT BE WRONG AT YOUR AGE  BUT AT YOUR AGE ARE WE OF COURSE NOT DECEIVE ONESELF  MAY YOU BE DISILLUSIONED WITH THE WORLD YOU ARE LEAVING AND BE FOREVER  DO NOT WORRY ELSEWHERE  YOUNG LIKE YOU AND THEN A STRANGER LIKE YOU IN MONTENEGRO  I WENT THERE TO FIND A ASYLUM  AND THE SAME BENEVOLENCE WELCOMED ME AMONG THESE PASTORS FROM WHICH I WAS ALSO AFRAID OF BEING PUSHED BACK  GO    HE CONTINUED WITH A KIND OF AUTHORITY    TAKE POSSESSION OF THE LAND THAT I HAVE FOR YOU SHOWN  IT DID NOT BELONG TO ANY PARTICULAR MAN  BUT TO THE FIRST COME  AND WE ARE NOT AT THE POINT OF HAVING TO SUPPRESS THE EXCESS OF AN EMBARRASSING POPULATION  ONE HUNDRED FAMILIES OCCUPY HERE A TERRITORY WHICH WOULD SUFFICE FOR A PEOPLE  CHILDREN OF YOUR CHILDREN WILL GROW THERE WITHOUT BEING DEPENDENT ON THEIR NEIGHBORS AND WITHOUT SUFFERING FROM THE ASPECT OF MISERY  FAREWELL    HE SAID TO ME    WORK  PRAY  AND ENJOY THE PEACE OF YOUR HEART       I WAS LEFT ALONE  HAPPY WITH THE FEELING OF MY FREEDOM  AND MASTER OF FERTILE SOIL THAT HARDLY REQUIRED ANY WORK THAT THEIR EASE AND SUCCESS ALWAYS TURNED INTO PLEASURE  MY WILDERNESS WAS WATERED BY THE WATERS OF AN ABUNDANT STREAM WHICH  FROM TIME TO TIME SWELLED BY THUNDERSTORMS  CASCADED FROM THE TOP OF MY ROCKS  AND WENT TO BATHE FAR AWAY FROM THE ORCHARDS TOO RICH FOR MY NEEDS  BUT THE FRUITS OF WHICH ATTRACTED INNUMERABLE FAMILIES OF TRAVELING BIRDS  I WAS ENJOYING WITH DELIGHTS OF THE PLEASURE OF SHIELDING THESE PASSING GUESTS FROM MY GARDENS AGAINST THE UNFORESEEN VICISSITUDES OF THE SEASONS  HAPPY WHEN I DELIGHTED THE BEE ITSELF  THE BEE SUDDENLY SEIZED BY A EVENING BREEZE  TO THE DEADLY ACTION OF THE COLD  AND WHEN I REPORTED  WARMED BY MY BREATH  IN THE HOLLOW OF THE ROCK SOLITARY WHERE SHE USED TO FIND HER SHELTER  I LIVED THUS TWO YEARS WITHOUT COMMUNICATING WITH ANYONE  I HAD TEN  EIGHT THEN  AND THE HABIT OF A RURAL LIFE HAD DEVELOPED MY FORCES SO AS TO AMAZE MYSELF     I WAS HAPPY  I REPEAT  HAPPY BECAUSE I WAS FREE  BECAUSE I WAS SURE I WAS  AND I DON T KNOW ANYTHING MORE SUITABLE TO FILL THE HEART OF MAN WITH DELICIOUS EMOTIONS THAT THAT THOUGHT HE SO RARELY ENJOYS  HOW EVERYTHING ENCHANTED ME  AS EVERYTHING MADE ME BESIDE MYSELF IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE NATURE  OFTEN HOWEVER I WAS TORMENTED BY A NEED INCONCEIVABLE TO BE LOVED  AND THE DISTRESSING PERSUASION THAT EVER A WOMAN OF MY CHOICE WOULD NOT COME TO THESE DESERTS TO ASSOCIATE WITH MY FATE  I FELT THEN THAT THE MOST TENDER FEELING CAN TO TURN TO FURY IN A PASSIONATE HEART  I OVERWHELMED THE WORLD WHO POSSESSED THIS UNKNOWN TREASURE OF ALL THE HATRED THAT I WOULD HAVE BROUGHT TO A HAPPY RIVAL  I DREAMED WITH SPITE  WITH A JEALOUSY ANGER  TO THESE YOUNG GIRLS DAZZLED BY THE FINERY OF FASHION AND FLATTERY OF A FEW EFFEMINATE WORSHIPERS  WHO HAD LEFT FALL ON ME A DISDAINFUL LOOK BECAUSE OF MY DARKNESS OR MY TOO GREAT YOUTH  I FELT WITH A KIND OF RAGE THAT HE WOULD BE SWEET TO UNDECEIVE THEM ONE DAY FROM THE PREJUDICES OF THEIR VANITY  SPILLING BLOOD UNDER THEIR EYES OR SCARING THEM THE LIGHT OF A FIRE     PARDON  ANTONIA  FOR THE DELIRIUM OF A CRAZY YOUTH ABANDONED TO ITS PASSIONS     I WAS PURPOSELY LOOKING FOR MOUNTAIN BEARS TO ATTACK THEM WITH A STAKE WHICH WAS THE ONLY WEAPON I HAD  AND I REGRETTED THAT THESE WOMEN WERE NOT OBLIGED TO COME TO TAKE REFUGE  TREMBLING WITH TERROR  UNDER THE PROTECTION OF MY ARM  BECAUSE I SAW THEM EVERYWHERE  I DID NOT FREQUENT THE OTHER MERITED SHEPHERDS  WHO HARDLY SAW EACH OTHER BETWEEN THEM  BUT I WAS KNOWN BY SOME COURAGE AND BY A GREAT PHYSICAL STRENGTH THAT CHANCE HAD SOMETIMES GIVEN ME TRY BEFORE THEIR EYES     THE ODDITY OF MY APPEARANCE  THE ABSOLUTE ISOLATION IN WHICH I WAS LIVING  AND FROM WHICH NO CIRCUMSTANCE HAD BROUGHT ME OUT  THIS WHICH WAS MAINLY BROUGHT BACK FROM MY VIGOR AND MY AUDACITY  HAD ACQUIRED THIS POPULAR CREDIT THAT THE SAVAGES GIVE TO THE EXTRAORDINARY LIKE CIVILIZED MEN     ONE DAY THE CLEMENTINE MOUNTAINS WERE TAKEN OVER BY FOREIGN TROOPS  SOME ADVENTUROUS DETACHMENTS CAME THERE PASS AWAY  THEY WERE SUPPORTED BY AN ARMY THAT DID NOT TRY TO CONTROL THEM  TO FOLLOW  BUT WHICH THREATENED OUR SOLITUDES FOR A TIME  THE BOCAGE OF LOWER PLATEAU WHERE I LIVED IS ALMOST INACCESSIBLE  THAT THERE WOULD COME TO SEEK THE GREED OF NEIGHBORING PEOPLES  BUT MANY OF OUR BRETHREN OUTSIDE WERE DEAD  WE WE GOT UP TO REPLACE THEM  THE CHANCE OF THE BATTLE DELIVERED ME PRISONER TO OUR ENEMIES  DESPITE MY RESOLVE  I HAD EVERYTHING MADE TO DIE  FOR LIFE WEARIED ME  BUT I LOST THE ACQUAINTANCE WITH BLOOD  AND I WAS DRAGGED AWAY  IT WOULD BE VERY LONG AND VERY USELESS TO TELL     WHAT MY LIFE HAS BECOME SINCE IS ANOTHER MYSTERY THAT HE MAY NEED TO EXPLAIN  BUT HOW MANY TIMES DOES THE MEMORY OF THIS INVIOLABLE AND DELICIOUS ASYLUM  WHICH I ACQUIRED IN A NEW SOCIETY  BEYOND THE POWERS AND LAWS OF THE EARTH  HAS MAKES MY BREAST THROB  HOW MANY TIMES I WOULD HAVE LEFT IT ALL FOR REGAIN POSSESSION  IF THE ASCENDANCY OF AN INVINCIBLE FEELING HADN T HELD ME BACK      SINCE A LONG TIME    SAID ANTONIA     SINCE I SAW YOU   REPLIED LOTHARIO COLDLY    AND IF MY HEART  LESS RECKLESS IN ITS FEELINGS  HAD BECOME ATTACHED TO SOME ISOLATED WOMAN LIKE ME IN THE MIDST OF THE WORLD  WHO COULD HAVE UNDERSTAND AND ENVY THE HAPPINESS OF MY GROVES    IT WAS THE DREAM OF THE YOUTH      IT SEEMS TO ME  LOTHARIO    SAID MADAME ALBERTI    THAT YOU ARE CREATING CHIMERAS TO FIGHT THEM  I HAVE NOT EXAMINED  I HAVE NOT EVEN UNDERTAKEN TO DELVE DEEPER INTO THE STRANGE SECRET THAT MAKES YOU GIVE UP SO EARLY ON ALL THE ADVANTAGES THAT YOUR HAPPY QUALITIES GAVE YOU CAUSE FOR HOPE IN THE WORLD  BUT MY EXISTENCE IS UNCONDITIONALLY LINKED TO THE EXISTENCE OF MY SISTER  AND I ALREADY KNOW THAT SHE IS READY TO SUBMIT TO WILD WHIMS OF YOUR PHILOSOPHY  UNTIL YOU LIKE TO COME BACK TO A KIND OF LIFE MORE WORTHY OF HER AND YOU  SHE ALONE HAS THE RIGHT TO DISOWN MYSELF      LET S GO TO THE CLEMENTINE MOUNTAINS    SAID ANTONIA  THROWING HERSELF IN HIS SISTER S ARMS      TO THE CLEMENTINE MOUNTAINS    EXCLAIMED LOTHARIO    ANTONIA Y WOULD HAVE COME    SHE WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED ME THERE  AND THE DEPRIVATION OF SUCH HAPPINESS WOULD NOT SUFFICE FOR MY ETERNAL PUNISHMENT      THE DOOR OPENED TO ORDINARY VISITORS    A WEIGHT OF ICE FELL ON ANTONIA S HEART  LOTHARIO APPROACHED FROM HER GENTLY  AND COVERING HIS TRANSPORTS WITH AN APPEARANCE COLD AND POLISHED     TO THE CLEMENTINE MOUNTAINS    HE REPEATED IN A LOW VOICE    ANTONIA WOULD HAVE COME      ANTONIA SEARCHED FOR HER SISTER S EYES     EVERYWHERE    SHE SAID  POINTING TO HER    EVERYWHERE WITH HER  AND WITH LOTHARIO      LET ME DREAM    HE RESUMED    OF THE HAPPINESS THAT IS RESERVED FOR ME OR THE ONE I LOST  I M NOT CALM ENOUGH TO SEE DISTINCTLY MY FUTURE    TOMORROW     OR NEVER      LOTHARIO HAD GONE OUT IN THE GREATEST CONFUSION  THE HEART OF ANTONIA WAS NOT QUIETER  HIS WORRY HAD BECOME A AWFUL PERPLEXITY  TWO HOURS LATER  MATTEO ENTERED  AND PRESENTED A LETTER TO ANTONIA  WHO GAVE IT TO MADAME ALBERTI  THEY WERE ALONE  THIS POST WAS WRITTEN IN THESE TERMS     NEVER  ANTONIA  NEVER  DON T ACCUSE ME  FORGET ME     AFTER TO HAVE CRIED FOR A WHILE  I RENOUNCE EVERYTHING  THE ONLY HAPPINESS THAT MY MISERABLE HEART HAS NEVER UNDERSTOOD  I M GOING TO SEEK DEATH WHO SPARED ME FOR TOO LONG  O MY ANTONIA  IF THIS WORLD TO WHICH YOU BELIEVE MAY ONE DAY OPEN TO THE VOICE OF REPENTANCE  IF  AMONG THE CHILDREN OF GOD  THERE ARE NONE WHO ARE DISINHERITED IN ADVANCE  I WILL SEE YOU AGAIN    SEE YOU AGAIN  ALAS  NEVER  ANTONIA  NEVER     LOTHARIO    MADAME ALBERTI HAD READ THESE LINES IN A TREMBLING VOICE  AND WITHOUT DARE TO LOOK UP AT HIS SISTER  WHEN SHE LOOKED AT ANTONIA  SHE WAS FRIGHTENED BY HIS PALLOR AND HIS STILLNESS  A TERRIBLE BLOW HAD JUST BEEN BROUGHT TO THIS WEAK HEART  AND MADAME ALBERTI CONCEIVED THAT THIS BLOW WAS IRREPARABLE    THE DEPARTURE OF LOTHARIO WAS KNOWN THE SAME DAY IN VENICE  AND  ACCORDING TO CUSTOM  HE GAVE RISE TO A HOST OF CONJECTURES VARIOUS  EACH STRANGER THAN THE NEXT  WHEN ANTONIA WAS ABLE TO THINK ABOUT IT  SHE SAW ONLY A TERRIBLE ENIGMA  WHOSE WORD SHE COULDN T LOOK UP WITHOUT FEELING HER HEART TO FAINT AND HIS REASON TO GO ASTRAY  ONLY ONCE DID SHE BELIEVE A MOMENT TO BE ABLE TO GRASP ITS MYSTERY  SINCE THE DAY LOTHARIO HAD SAID HER LAST FAREWELL TO ANTONIA  TOMORROW OR NEVER  WE HAD AVOIDED LETTING HER ENTER THIS APARTMENT  WHICH RECALLED THAT CRUEL THOUGHTS AND MORTAL REGRETS  AS SHE HAD MANAGED TO GET IN WITHOUT WITNESSES  AND THAT SHE LOOKED THOUGHTFULLY AT THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD LEFT IT  SHE SAW  AT THE FOOT OF THE SEAT ON WHICH SHE WAS SITTING  SMALL SHELVES OF RUSSIAN LEATHER  GARNISHED WITH A STEEL CLIP WHOSE SPRING WAS BROKEN  SHE SEIZES IT  AND THINKING THAT THEY COULD CONTAIN THE EXPLANATION SHE NEEDED  THAT MAYBE EVEN LOTHARIO HAD NOT ABANDONED THEM WITHOUT PURPOSE IN THIS PLACE  THEY EAGERLY OPENED THEM  AND WALKED THERE QUICKLY HIS LOOKS  THEY ONLY CONTAINED A DOZEN SCATTERED PAGES  DRAWN SOMETIMES WITH A PENCIL  SOMETIMES WITH A FEATHER  DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE IDEAS PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO LOTHARIO S IMAGINATION    TWO OR THREE OF THOSE LINES WERE WRITTEN IN BLOOD    THEY OFFERED LITTLE CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM  BUT ALMOST ALL WERE INSPIRED BY THIS FATAL SPIRIT OF PARADOX  BY THIS WILD AND EXALTED MISANTHROPY WHICH DOMINATED IN HIS SPEECHES    TOO CONCERNED WITH THE FEELINGS THAT FILLED HER HEART TO TO BECOME ATTACHED TO THEIR MEANING  AND TO SEE IN THEM SOMETHING OTHER THAN WHAT THEY OFFERED MORE REMARKABLE  SINGULAR IMAGES  DREAMY THOUGHTS  STREAKS OF DARK ENERGY  BUT NOTHING WHO COULD DISPEL HER DOUBTS OR FIX THEM  ANTONIA CLOSED THE TABLETS OF LOTHARIO  AND HID THEM IN HIS BOSOM  WITHOUT COMMUNICATE TO MRS  ALBERTI      XIII   LET S NOT TRY TO UNRAVEL WHY THE INNOCENT MOANED  WHILE THAT THE CRIME IS CLOTHED WITH THE ROBE OF HONOR  THE DAY OF VENGEANCE  THE DAY OF ETERNAL RETRIBUTION ALONE CAN WE REVEAL THE SECRET OF THE JUDGE AND THE VICTIM   HERVEY    LOTHARIO TABLETS    MOUNT TAURUS RAISED ITS FOREHEAD ABOVE ALL THE HILLS   ONE OF THEM SAID TO HIM  I AM ONLY A HILL  BUT I CONTAIN A VOLCANO       THE SOCIETY  THAT IS TO SAY A HANDFUL OF PATRICIANS  PUBLICANS AND OMENS  AND ON THE OTHER SIDE  THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE WHOLE IN HIS SWADDLING CLOTHES AND IN HIS EDGES            THE LEGISLATORS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY RESEMBLE THE ARCHITECTS OF LYCERUS  WHO CARRIED THE MATERIALS OF A PALACE INTO THE AIR  AND WHO DID NOT DEAL WITH THE FOUNDATIONS       WORN OUT PEOPLES ASK TO BE RULED  THE PEOPLES DEPRAVED NEED TO BE SUBMISSIVE  FREEDOM IS FOOD GENEROUS WHICH IS ONLY SUITABLE FOR A HEALTHY AND ROBUST ADOLESCENCE       WHEN POLITICS HAS BECOME A SCIENCE OF WORDS  EVERYTHING IS LOST  THERE IS SOMETHING MORE VILE IN THE WORLD THAN THE SLAVE OF A TYRANT  IT IS THE DUPE OF A SOPHIST       IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT MEN CUT THEIR THROATS FOR THEIR RIGHTS  AND THAT THESE SO CALLED HUMAN RIGHTS ARE JUST WORDS MYSTICS INTERPRETED BY LAWYERS  WHY DON T WE TALK NEVER TO MAN THE FIRST OF HUMAN RIGHTS  HIS RIGHT TO A SHARE OF LAND DETERMINED IN THE PROPORTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL TERRITORY       WHAT IS THIS LAW WHICH BEARS THE EMBLEMS AND THE NAME OF EQUALITY ON ITS FRONTISPIECE  IS IT AGRARIAN LAW    NO IT S THE CONTRACT FOR THE SALE OF A NATION DELIVERED TO THE RICH BY SCHEMERS AND FACTIONISTS WHO WANT TO GET RICH       A MAN FLATTERS THE PEOPLE  HE PROMISES TO SERVE HIM  IT IS CAME TO POWER  IT IS BELIEVED THAT HE WILL ASK FOR THE SHARING OF GOODS  IT S NOT THAT  HE ACQUIRES GOODS  AND HE ASSOCIATES WITH THE TYRANTS FOR THE SHARING OF THE PEOPLE       THE SACRED WORD OF THE HEBREWS IS GOLD  THERE IS A WAY TO UTTER IN THE EAR OF THE JUDGES OF THE EARTH WHICH BRINGS DOWN YOUR STIFF ENEMY DEAD       LYCURGUS THOUGHT A STRANGE THING  IT IS THAT THE THEFT WAS THE ONLY INSTITUTION THAT COULD MAINTAIN SOCIAL BALANCE       ARE YOU NOT TIRED  YOUNG MAN  OF REAPING THE GARDENS OF TANTALUM  OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE EVILS OF HUMANITY  LOOKED  THE CURTIUS GULF IS STILL OPEN AND IT TAKES A LOT RUSH FOR THE SALVATION OF THE WORLD       THE ALMS ARE A PARTIAL RESTITUTION  MADE AMICABLY  THE BEGGAR COMPROMISES  LET S PLEAD       PULL A MAN OUT OF THE WOODS  AND SHOW HIM THE COMPANY  HE WILL SOON BE CORRUPT AND CONTEMPTIBLE LIKE YOU  BUT HE WILL WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND THE IMPASSIVE AREOPAGUS WHO COLDLY SENDS A BEGGAR AT THE GALLOWS FOR DECIMATING THE BANQUET OF A MILLIONAIRE       IT IS A DIFFICULT QUESTION TO DECIDE WHAT IS MORE HIDEOUS IN THE SOCIAL LIFE OF THE OFFENSE OR THE LAW  THIS THAT THERE IS MORE CRUEL OF THE GUILTY OR THE JUDGE  THE CRIME OR THE PUNISHMENT  OPINIONS ARE VERY DIVIDED       KILLING A MAN IN THE HEIGHT OF A PASSION IS UNDERSTANDABLE   HAVE HIM KILLED BY ANOTHER IN A PUBLIC PLACE  IN PEACE OF SERIOUS MEDITATION AND UNDER THE PRETEXT OF A MINISTRY HONORABLE  THIS IS NOT UNDERSTANDABLE       A SCARY THING TO THINK ABOUT IS THAT EQUALITY  WHICH IS THE OBJECT OF ALL OUR WISHES AND ALL OUR REVELATIONS  ACTUALLY FINDS THAT IN TWO STATES OF MAN  SLAVERY AND THE DEATH       TO SEE PEOPLE STRUGGLE AROUND AN IDEA LIKE ANTS FOR A BIT OF STRAW  THERE IS ENOUGH TO DIE OF CONFUSION  A BIT OF STRAW  AT LEAST THAT S SOMETHING  AND A IDEA  IT S NOTHING       THE THEFT OF THE POOR FROM THE RICH  IF WE GO BACK TO THE ORIGIN OF THINGS  WOULD  IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS  ONLY BE A REPAIR  THAT IS TO SAY THE CORRECT AND RECIPROCAL DISPLACEMENT OF A PIECE OF MONEY OR A PIECE OF BREAD THAT TURNS OVER FROM THE THIEF S HANDS IN THE HANDS OF THE STOLEN       THE HIGHEST REACH OF FREEDOM THAT A NATION WHICH IS AWARE OF ITS SOVEREIGNTY  IT IS THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE SLAVERY TO HIS LIKING       THERE IS A GREAT OBSTACLE TO THE LIBERATION OF CITIES  THIS ARE THE CITIES     SHOW ME A TOWN  A BEEHIVE OR AN ANTHILL  AND I WILL SHOW SLAVERY  ONLY THE LION AND THE EAGLE ARE KINGS  BECAUSE THAT THEY ARE LONELY       WICKEDNESS IS A SOCIAL DISEASE  THE NATURAL MAN IS NOT MORE EVIL THAN ANOTHER BRUTE  CIVILIZED MAN CREATES HORROR OR PITY  COUNT THE FLOORS OF A HOUSE  AND REMEMBER THE PARABLE OF BABEL       IF I HAD THE SOCIAL PACT AT MY DISPOSAL  I WOULDN T CHANGE IT NOTHING  I WOULD TEAR IT UP       THE FRUIT OF THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL IS THE SOCIETY  THE FIRST TIME MAN WRAPPED HIMSELF IN A GIRDLE OF FOLIAGE  HE TOOK ON SLAVERY AND DEATH      THERE ARE TWO VERY OPPOSITE INSTINCTS IN THE SIMPLE MAN  THE INSTINCT OF CONSERVATION FOR HIM AND FOR THAT WHICH PROCEEDS FROM HIM  THE INSTINCT OF DESTRUCTION FOR ALL THAT IS TAUGHT TO HIM AND ORDERED  THE COMPANY IS THEREFORE FALSE       ALL THE WORKS OF GOD ARE ACCOMPLISHED IN THEIR DESTINATION AND IN THEIR END  IF THE COMPANY HAD ENTERED FOR THE PURPOSE OF CREATION  THE LARK WOULD NEVER LEAD ITS YOUNG IN A FIELD OF WHEAT RIPE AND READY FOR HARVEST       THERE ARE FEW MEN WHOSE HEARTS DO NOT QUIVER WITH INDIGNATION AND OF PAIN AT THE SIGHT OF A PROUD LION TIED UP IN A CAGE OF IRON  AND HUMBLY LICKING THE BLOODY HAND OF THE BUTCHER WHO NOURISHES  WHAT MUST THE MAN WHO LOOKS AT THE MAN THINK       TO MAKE POLITICAL INEQUALITY LESS OUTRAGEOUS  ALMOST ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT MADE IT REST ON BENEFITS MORALITIES HAVE AT LEAST LINKED THE ORIGIN TO GENEROUS MEMORIES OR SACRED TRADITIONS  IT HAS NOT YET BEEN FOUND LEGISLATION DEPRAVED ENOUGH TO CONFESS IN ITS INSTITUTIONS THE ARISTOCRACY OF MONEY  WHEN WE GET THERE  THE WEATHER WILL BE FINE LIVE  BECAUSE EVERYTHING WILL END       IT IS VERY HUMILIATING FOR THE SPECIES THAT THE SLAVES ARE NOT IN THE MINORITY NOWHERE IN A HUMAN SOCIETY  WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO CHANGE A BAD PLACE FOR A GOOD ONE  WHEN WE HAVE THE STRENGTH AND NUMBER       NOTHING IS EASIER THAN TO PERSUADE A MAN THAT HE DEPENDS ON MAN  BY VIRTUE OF A MYSTERIOUS RIGHT  FOUNDED ON A TITLE UNKNOWN  BUT HOW TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND  WHAT IS TRUE  THAT ITS DEPENDENCE RESULTS PURELY AND SIMPLY FROM THE INEQUALITY OF A OLD DIVISION OF THE LAND  WHICH HAS NEITHER CHANGED SHAPE NOR EXTENT  AND WHO CAN BE CHALLENGED EVERY DAY       THE BEE S HIVE DOES NOT BELONG TO THE HORNET  BUT THE FIELD FLOWERS BELONG TO ALL AIR INSECTS  THE THE ONLY INVIOLABLE PROPERTY OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS HIS INDUSTRY       IS IT TRUE THAT MOST OF THE SOVEREIGNS OF EUROPE ARE TO REGISTER THE LAND  IS      ESTABLISHING MONARCHIES TODAY IS A GREAT PITY    I WAS NOT SURPRISED TO FIND THE CELL OF A HALF HERMIT HIDDEN IN THE ASH OF THE CRATER  BUT THAT A KING THINKS OF BUILDING HIS THRONE AT THE BOTTOM  I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT       TO BEND THE BOW OF NIMROD FOR THE LAST TIME IS NOT RARE WONDER  NAPOLEON  TEN OTHERS HAVE DONE IT BEFORE YOU    PASS AGAIN TO BREAK IT       OUR VENICE FIREWORKS END WITH A SPRAY OF FIRE WHICH WOULD ECLIPSE THE SUN IN ITS MIDDAY     THE NIGHT IS ONLY DEEPER AFTER THAT  THE NIGHT THAT BELONGS TO THIEVES     THE DAY AFTER A GREAT NATION IS THE NIGHT OF A FIRE FIREWORKS       IF YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN YOUR PROJECTS    THEY SAY    IT WOULD BE TO START AGAIN TOMORROW       THE GREAT EVIL TO START AGAIN TOMORROW   WE ARE SO GOOD TODAY       WHEN WE HAVE CEASED TO LIVE FIRST IN THE HEART OF ANOTHER  WE IS VERY REALLY DEAD  ALL THAT S MISSING IS THE WAY       A SOCIETY WHICH KILLS A MAN IS QUITE CONVINCED THAT IT IS JUSTICE    IMMENSE AND SUBLIME RETRIBUTIVE JUSTICE THAN THAT OF A MAN WHO WOULD KILL SOCIETY       TWO CRIMES FOR WHICH I HAVE NO MERCY  HURTING WHOM CAN NOT DEFEND HIMSELF  AND STEAL WHO NEEDS    TORTURES AND CURSES ON THE INFAMOUS WHO STOLE THE DOG OF A BLIND MAN       THE SAVAGE OF THE SOUTH SEA WHO GIVES A WOMAN FOR AN AX DOES NOT MAKE A BAD DEAL  WHAT IS THE COUNTRY WHERE WE WOULD NOT HAVE NOT A WOMAN WITH AN AX       THERE ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF MAN THREE ERRORS OR THREE MYSTERIES WHICH DECIDE TO LIVE  GOD  LOVE AND FREEDOM    AND THERE IS SOON TWO THOUSAND YEARS THAT THE COMPANY WOULD NO LONGER EXIST  IF A FEW BEGGARS IN GALILEE DID NOT DARE TO MAKE A RELIGION WITH THAT    HOW MANY SPECULATORS DO YOU KNOW WHO WOULD INVEST IN THE PROBABLE DURATION OF THIS LAST INSTITUTION OF THE POLITICAL WORLD A SEQUIN LIFE ANNUITY       I WOULD LIKE TO BE SHOWN IN HISTORY A MONARCHY WHICH WAS NOT FOUNDED BY A THIEF       WHEN THE NATIONS REACH THEIR LAST PERIOD  THERE IS NO LONGER BETWEEN THEM A RALLYING CRY  EVERYTHING IS TO ALL      AND THE DAY WHEN THE STANDARD WHICH WILL CARRY THIS MOTTO WILL BE WET FROM THE CRYING OF A CHILD  I WILL TEAR IT OUT TO MAKE MYSELF ONE SHROUD       THE HISTORY OF ANCIENT PEOPLES IS NOT DIFFICULT TO TELL  THE HISTORY OF THE PEOPLES TO COME IS NOT DIFFICULT TO PREDICT    THE FATHERS  THE OLD MEN  THE WISE MEN  THE PRIESTS  THE SOLDIERS  THE KINGS    AND THEN AFTER     THE PEOPLES PERHAPS           THERE ARE ONLY THREE WAYS TO LINK YOUR MEMORY TO THAT OF THE TEMPLE OF DELPHI  YOU HAVE TO BUILD IT  CONSECRATE IT  OR SET IT ON FIRE       GIVE ME A FORCE THAT DARES TO TAKE THE NAME OF LAW  AND I WILL WILL SHOW A FLIGHT THAT WILL TAKE THE PROPERTY NAME       FREEDOM IS NOT SUCH A RARE TREASURE  IT IS IN THE HAND OF ALL THE STRONG  AND IN THE PURSE OF ALL THE RICH       YOU ARE MASTER OF MY MONEY  AND I AM MASTER OF YOUR LIFE  THIS BELONGS TO US  NEITHER TO YOU NOR TO ME  GIVE BACK  AND I LEAVE       A THOUSAND FORTUNES FOR A THOUGHT  A THOUSAND THOUGHTS FOR A FEELING   A THOUSAND FEELINGS FOR AN ACTION  A THOUSAND SUBLIME ACTIONS FOR ONE HAIR     AND THE WORLD  AND THE FUTURE  AND ETERNITY WITH IT ALL       THE FOUNDER OF A NEW SECT  POOR MAN  THE ILLUMINATOR OF OLD MORALITY  POOR MAN  A LEGISLATOR  POOR MAN    A CONQUEROR  WHAT MISERY       IF THERE IS A GOOD SOCIETY IN THE WORLD  IT IS ONE WHERE WE SHARE WHILE GIVING A PREMIUM TO THE STRONGEST    WHEN CUNNING AND BETRAYAL GET INVOLVED  LEGISLATION COMES ALONG       I ONLY KNOW OF ONE PROFESSION TO BE DISCREDITED  THAT OF GOD       I HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN ASKED IF I LIKE CHILDREN  I BELIEVE HIM GOOD  THEY ARE NOT YET MEN       ALL THE VOICES OF THE EARTH ONCE ANNOUNCED THAT THE GREAT PAN WAS DEAD  IT WAS THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES  WHEN YOU HEAR A SECOND TIME  IT WILL BE THE EMANCIPATION OF THE POOR   AND THEN THE USURPATION OF THE WORLD WILL BEGIN AGAIN       OF ALL GOVERNMENTS  THE ONE THAT LEAST REVOLTS MY HEART  THE ONE THAT DEGRADES HUMANITY THE LEAST IS THE DESPOTISM OF THE EAST  WHERE THE DEGRADATION OF PEOPLES IS AT LEAST EXPLAINED BY SUPERSTITIONS  I CONCEIVE OF A TYRANT WHO DESCENDS FROM THE PROPHETS AND WHO IS AN ALLY OF THE STARS  IN TIBET  HE IS INVISIBLE  IMMORTAL  SACRED  THIS IS GOOD  IT SHOULD NEVER BE INDIFFERENT  TYRANNY AND SLAVERY ARE TWO STATES WHICH INVOLVE TWO CASH  THE MOST DEGRADED OF MEN ARE THE SLAVES WHO RECOGNIZE TYRANTS MADE IN THEIR IMAGE       WE HAVE MANY GRACES TO GIVE TO OUR STAR  WHEN WE CAN TO LEAVE MEN WITHOUT BEING OBLIGED TO HURT THEM AND DECLARE THEIR ENEMY       WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CRIME AND AN ACTION HEROIC  BETWEEN TORTURE AND APOTHEOSIS  THE PLACE  THE TIME  THE CONTEMPTIBLE OPINION OF A STUPID CROWD WHO DO NOT KNOW THE REAL NAME OF THINGS  AND WHICH RANDOMLY APPLIES THOSE THAT USAGE HAS TAUGHT HIM       THE PLAGUES ARE IN THE ORDER OF NATURE  AND THE LAWS ARE NOT THERE NOT       IT WAS AN IDEA LESS APPROPRIATE TO THE DIVINITY  AS I CONCEIVE  BUT WHICH HAD SOMETHING CONSOLING FOR THE MAN THAN TO GIVE INFIRMITIES TO THE GODS  I LIKE THAT APOLLO IS BANISHED  THAT CERES SUFFERS FROM HUNGER IN STELLION S MOTHER  THAT VENUS BE WOUNDED BY DIOMEDES  MAY THE CRADLE OF HERCULES BE SURROUNDED BY SERPENTS LIKE THAT OF GENIUS  AND THAT HE HIMSELF DIES DEVOURED BY THIS ROBE OF NESSUS WHICH HE BEQUEATHED TO THESE SUCCESSORS       IF MY HEART COULD GIVE ITSELF FAITH     IF I HAD A GOD TO TO INVENT  I WISH HE WERE BORN ON THE STRAW OF A STABLE  THAT HE HAD ESCAPED FROM THE ASSASSINS ONLY IN THE ARMS OF A POOR MAN CRAFTSMAN WHO WOULD HAVE PASSED FOR HIS FATHER  THAT HIS CHILDHOOD WOULD HAVE BEEN SPENT IN MISERY AND EXILE  HE WOULD HAVE BEEN PROSCRIBING ALL HIS LIFE  DESPISED BY THE GREAT  UNKNOWN TO KINGS  PERSECUTED BY PRIESTS  DISOWNED BY HIS FRIENDS  SOLD BY ONE OF HIS DISCIPLES  ABANDONED BY THE MOST UPRIGHT OF HIS JUDGES  DEVOTED TO THE TORMENT OF PREFERABLY THE LAST OF THE SCOUNDRELS  WHIPPED WITH RODS  CROWNED THORNS  OUTRAGED BY THE EXECUTIONERS  AND THAT HE WOULD HAVE PERISHED BETWEEN TWO THIEVES  ONE OF WHOM FOLLOWED HIM INTO THE SKY       ALMIGHTY GOD  HAVE MERCY ON ME      XIV   IT IS I WHO LEAD TO THE LIVING ROOM OF MOANS  IT IS I WHO LEAD IN ETERNAL PAIN  IT S SOFT THAT LEAD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CONDEMNED PEOPLE OF THE REBELS  LEAVE ALL HOPE  YOU WHO COME IN   DANTE    SINCE LOTHARIO LEFT  ANTONIA S MELANCHOLY HAD MADE RAPID PROGRESS  SHE HAD FALLEN INTO A DEPRESSION OF SO MUCH SCARIER THAN SHE SEEMED TO IGNORE OR HAVE FORGOT THE CAUSE  HIS SADNESS WAS NOT DETERMINED  IT WAS A VAGUE UNEASINESS FROM WHICH SHE WAS DRAGGED WITH LIVELY DISTRACTION  BUT WHERE SHE WAS RETURNING FASTER THAN SHE HAD LEFT  HE HIM OFTEN SMILED  AND SOMETIMES EVEN WITHOUT A MOTIVE  SO HIS GAIETY WAS PAINFUL TO SEE  BECAUSE THE EXPRESSION OF HIS PHYSIOGNOMY DID NOT SEEM TO AGREE WELL WITH THE STATE OF HIS HEART  NEVER HAD SHE LOOKED MORE CAREFULLY FOR WALKS LONELY  ALMOST ALL THE PLACES SHE FREQUENTED HIM LOTHARIO REMEMBERED  BUT SHE NEVER NAMED HIM  SHE AVOIDED THE CONVERSATIONS IN WHICH HIS MEMORY COULD MINGLE  WE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS TRYING TO CONVINCE HERSELF THAT HE DID NOT EXIST FOR HER  AND THAT IN HER LIFE HE WAS ONLY THE ILLUSION OF A DREAM OR OF A FIT OF DELIRIUM  ON THE CONTRARY  SHE OFTEN TOOK CARE OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER  WHOM SHE HAD NOT NAMED FOR A LONG TIME  AND SHE SPOKE OF IT  AGAINST ITS USAGE  WITHOUT SHEDDING TEARS  AS IF IT HAD ONLY BEEN SEPARATED BY A SHORT SPACE OF WAY  AND THAT SHE WOULD SOON HAVE TO JOIN THEM    MADAME ALBERTI REGARDED THIS CIRCUMSTANCE AS SOMETHING HAPPY IN ANTONIA S SITUATION  SHE THOUGHT HER MEMORIES WOULD BE DESTROYED MORE EASILY BY EACH OTHER  AND THAT IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR HIM TO FORGET THE ANNOYANCES OF A FEELING WHICH SHE WAS STILL FAR FROM KNOWING ALL THE POWER  NEAR THE TOMB OF HIS PARENTS  SHE THEREFORE RESOLVED TO DRIVE ANTONIA BACK TO TRIESTE  AND ANTONIA RECEIVED THIS PROPOSAL WITH A TESTIMONY OF COLD SATISFACTION  THE ONLY ONE THAT HIS FEATURES GLOOMY AND HIS FIXED EYES COULD IMPERFECTLY MANIFEST  AT REMAINS  MADAME ALBERTI HAD NOT GIVEN UP ON HER OWN HOPE  SHE WAS QUITE CONVINCED  ON THE CONTRARY  AND THERE HAD INDEED NOTHING MORE PROBABLE THAN THE STRANGE PROCESS OF LOTHARIO WAS JUST ANOTHER EFFECT OF THE ODDITY OF HIS CHARACTER OR EMBARRASSMENT OF HIS POSITION  AND THAT HE WOULD NOT DELAY NOT TO COME BACK TO ANTONIA S FEET TO CLAIM THE RIGHTS THAT SHE HAD GIVEN TO A HAPPINESS THAT SEEMED TO PASS ALL ITS EXPECTATIONS    IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT THE REASONS WHICH MADE THIS NECESSARY SINGULAR SYSTEM IN WHICH HE ENVELOPED HIS ACTIONS PREVENTED HIM THEN TO FORM A KNOT WHICH  BY COMPLETELY FIXING ITS EXISTENCE  WOULD SUBJECT HIM TOO CLOSELY AND BY TOO MANY POINTS TO CURIOSITY MEN  AND WOULD REMOVE HIM FROM THIS WAVE OF CONJECTURES WHICH THE UNCERTAINTY WAS DOUBTLESS NOT USELESS TO HIM    IN THE STATE OF EUROPE  HOW MANY EMINENT MEN WERE FORCED  LIKE LOTHARIO IN HIDING THEIR NAME ACROSS TWENTY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES  AND TO ESCAPE LIKE HIM FROM THE DEEPEST AFFECTIONS  SWEETEST DUTIES OF NATURE  TO KEEP THEIR SAFETY  AND ABOVE ALL SO AS NOT TO COMPROMISE THAT OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE EXPENSIVE    THIS WAS EVIDENTLY LOTHARIO S SITUATION  AND IT WAS NECESSARY ALTHOUGH IT WOULD CHANGE ONE DAY  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ABSURD TO SEEK TO HIS CONDUCT ANOTHER EXPLANATION  ONE COULD EVEN THINK THAT IF HE HAD FEARED  WITH JUST CAUSE  TO PROLONG HIS STAY TOO MUCH IN A BIG CAPITAL WHERE HE WAS ALREADY VERY WELL KNOWN  HE WOULD NOT FAIL TO MOVE TOWARDS TRIESTE  WHEN HE HAD LEARNED THAT ANTONIA WAS BACK THERE    THESE ASSUMPTIONS WERE VERY LIKELY  AND ANTONIA DID NOT DID NOT REPEL THEM  ONLY SHE DID NOT ANSWER  AND LOOKED AT HIS SISTER DEFIANTLY WHEN IT WAS MENTIONED  THEN SHE THREW HERSELF INTO HIS ARMS    THE CASES THAT HAD CALLED THEM TO VENICE NOT HOLDING THEM BACK MORE  THEY LEFT ON A BOAT THAT WAS GOING TO TRIESTE BY THE LAGOONS  THIS WAY OF TRAVELING HAD SEEMED TO THEM PREFERABLE TO ANY OTHER  BECAUSE IT MADE THEM AVOID ROADS INFESTED BY JEAN SBOGAR S TROOP  AND ESPECIALLY THE DANGEROUS PASSAGE WHERE THEY HAD ALMOST BECOME HIS PRISONERS    THE LAGOON CHANNELS OFFER LITTLE INTEREST TO THE TRAVELER  TRACKS BY NATURE BETWEEN DESERTED AND ARID PORTIONS OF LAND THAT THE SEA INVADES AND ABANDONS IN TURN  AND WHICH CANNOT OFFER ASYLUM THAT THE WANDERING FLOCKS OF SHOREBIRDS  NOTHING VARIES  NOTHING ANIMATES THEIR SAD MONOTONY  THEY DO NOT PRESENT EVERYWHERE TO THE GAZE THAT STERILE STRIKES OR FORESTS OF REEDS  FROM WHICH SOMETIMES RISES WITH A LONG CRY THE HERON SURPRISED IN HIS SLEEP BY THE NOISE OF THE SAILORS AND PASSENGERS    ANTONIA  THOUGHTFUL  HAD NOT YET BEEN DISTRACTED BY ANY A CIRCUMSTANCE WORTHY OF OCCUPYING IT  WHEN NIGHT FELL AND CAME LEND ALL OBJECTS A CALMER AND GENTLER CHARACTER  THE THE SKY WAS STREWN WITH BRIGHT STARS  BUT THE MOON REFUSED HIM ITS LIGHT  NOTHING COULD BE SEEN OUTSIDE THE BOAT  AND THE THE ALTERNATING SWAYING OF THE ROWERS WAS BARELY VISIBLE THERE  WE COULD ONLY HEAR THE RHYTHMIC FALL OF THEIR OARS AND THE HISS OF WATER DIVIDED BY THE BOW  SUDDENLY MAN AT THE HELM BROKE THE SILENCE OF NATURE SINGING  IN A VOICE THAT WAS NOT WITHOUT PLEASURE  A FEW STANZAS FROM CUP WHERE ARE PAINTED IN HARMONIOUS VERSE THE DELIGHTS OF SOLITUDE BETWEEN TWO LOVERS EQUALLY IN LOVE  ITS ACCENTS  THAT NOTHING REFLECTED IN THE VASTNESS OF THE AIR AND THE SKY  AND WHICH STRETCHED UNHINDERED OVER THE SMOOTH SURFACE OF THE SEA  MADE THE SOUL PARTICIPATE IN THE ENJOYMENT OF THIS INFINITY IN WHICH THEY WERE GOING TO DIE  ANTONIA LISTENED TO THEM WITH A FEELING WHOSE GENTLENESS ASTONISHED HER  AND THAT A MOMENT BEFORE SHE WOULD HAVE NOT BELIEVED TO BE ABLE TO TASTE YET  SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO ATTRIBUTE THE CONFIDENCE WHICH FILLED HIS HEART  AND WHICH CALMED ALL THUNDERSTORMS  IT WAS NOT THE VIVID AND TUMULTUOUS ILLUSION OF FIRST HOPES  IT WAS THE RESTED ENJOYMENT OF A FUTURE PURE  IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THESE GUARDIAN INTELLIGENCES WHO WATCH ON THE LAST MOMENTS OF INNOCENCE  AND WHICH COME TO HIM TO OPEN THE ABODE OF ETERNAL REST  WERE TO THUS MANIFEST THEIR PRESENCE    MADAME ALBERTI FELT THE SAME EMOTION  HIS HAND HAD UNITED WITH THAT OF ANTONIA  THEY HAD LEANED AGAINST EACH OTHER  AND THEIR HEARTS BEAT WITH A STEADY AND GENTLE MOVEMENT  DIVES IN A LANGUOR THAT THE EXTREME STILLNESS OF THE AIR AND THE ALMOST INSENSIBLE RIPPLE OF THE WATERS CONTRIBUTED TO MAINTAIN  THEY FELL ASLEEP KISSING    THERE WAS LITTLE TIME THAT THEIR REST LASTED WHEN A BLOW OF RIFLE  FIRED AT A SHORT DISTANCE  DISTURBED ANTONIA S SLEEP  MADAME ALBERTI WAS STILL LEANING AGAINST HER  BUT SHE DID NOT DID NOT SPEAK  ANTONIA THOUGHT AT FIRST THAT SHE HAD DREAMED  BUT THE STILLNESS OF THE BOAT  THE SILENCE OF THE OARS  AND A FEW WORDS STRANGE SHE HEARD IN THE CONFUSED INTERVIEW OF THE SAILORS TERRIFIED  UNDECEIVED IT  SHE TRIED TO WAKE HER SISTER UP WITHOUT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE IT  SHE WANTED TO GET UP  AND FELT HERSELF SEIZE THE ARM BY A COLD  NERVOUS HAND      SHE S STILL A WOMAN    SAID A VOICE    JEAN WILL NOT BE  HAPPY      AT THESE WORDS  HER HAIR STOOD ON END ON HER FOREHEAD  A SWEAT COLD FLOODED HER LIMBS  AND SHE PASSED OUT  SHE DOES NOT CAME TO HER ONLY TO THE SOUND OF THE WHEELS OF A CAR DRIVING HER DROVE  AND UNDER WHICH TREMBLED  MUTTERING DULLY  THE RESOUNDING BOARDS OF A DRAWBRIDGE    SHE WAS ALONE    ANTONIA  RETURNED FROM THAT FIRST FIT OF ASTONISHMENT WHICH GAVE UNEXPECTED MISFORTUNES THE APPEARANCE OF A DREAM  WAS NOT LONG IN UNDERSTAND THIS ONE  THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT THEY WERE BANDITS STATIONED ON THE SEASHORE WHO HAD ARRESTED THE BOAT  AND THESE BANDITS COULD ONLY BELONG TO THE TROOP OF JEAN SBOGAR  GOT OUT OF THE CAR  AND SUPPORTED BY TWO MEN WHOSE BIZARRE CLOTHING AND FIERCE PHYSIOGNOMY FILLED HER OF DREAD WHENEVER THE LIGHTS SCATTERED UNDER THE VAULTS CAME TO ENLIGHTEN THEM  SHE WALKED THROUGH THE VAST GALLERIES  IMMENSE STAIRCASES  THE GOTHIC ROOMS OF THE CASTLE  CONFIRMING MORE AND MORE IN THE HORRIBLE IDEA THAT SHE WAS PRISONER IN DUINO    ARRIVED AT A ROOM WHICH SEEMED TO BE INTENDED FOR HIM  AND WHERE HIS AWFUL ESCORT LEFT HER FREE FOR A MOMENT  SHE RUSHED TOWARDS A OPEN WINDOW  AND SAW IN FRONT OF IT ONLY THE SEA  DISTANT  WHICH SEEMED TO HIM TO BE THAT OF THE LIGHTHOUSE OF AQUILEIA  SHONE ALONE IN THE MIDST OF THE NIGHT STARS  SHE NO LONGER DOUBTED HER WENT OUT  AND FELL IN PAIN IN A CHAIR     TO DUINO    SHE CRIED    JEAN SBOGAR      BUT WHAT HAVE WE DONE OF MY SISTER      THE SONOROUS VAULTS ALONE ANSWERED HIS CRIES    THE LAST WORD SHE HAD SPOKEN EXPIRED IN THEIR DEPTHS  LIKE A WEAK VOICE THAT DIES OUT  ANTONIA STOOD UP TERRIFIED  REPEATING   MY SISTER       IN THE TONE OF A PERSON AFFLICTED WITH A PAINFUL DREAM  AND TRYING TO WAKE UP    THE ILLUSION OF THE ECHO WAS RENEWED EVEN MORE SINISTER  SHE SOUNDED LIKE THE LAST MOAN OF A VIOLENT DEATH  THE UNHAPPY ANTONIA  ALMOST UNABLE TO SUPPORT HERSELF  LEANED AGAINST ONE OF THE LARGE PILASTERS OF THE FRONT DOOR  UNDER A LAMPPOST WHICH SHED ALL ITS LIGHT ON HER  SHE KISSED IN TREMBLING THE COLD COLUMN  STUCK HIS HALF COVERED FACE TO IT OF HIS FLOWING HAIR  AND FELT HIMSELF SAG UNDER THE WEIGHT OF HIS TERROR  A FEW MEN GROUPED IN THE CORRIDOR APPEARED LOOK FROM AFAR  BUT THE WEAKNESS OF HIS EYESIGHT LEFT HIM DISTINGUISH  IN THE SHADOWS WHERE THEY WERE HIDDEN  THAT THE MOVEMENT OF THEIR PLUMES  AND SHE WAS NOT SURE THAT SHE DECEIVE HIMSELF  WHEN A TERRIBLE CRY HIT HIS EAR    ONE OF THESE MEN HAD FLED BY NAMING HER    THE NIGHT WAS VERY LATE  WHEN ANTONIA GAVE IN FOR THE SECOND TIMES TO THESE CRUEL EMOTIONS  IT WASN T UNTIL MANY HOURS LATER THAT SHE COULD BE RETURNED ENTIRELY TO HERSELF  SHE WAS SURPRISED  LOOKING AROUND HER  OF THE DELICACY OF THE CARE WITH WHICH SHE WAS THE OBJECT  WE HAD TAKEN HER TO A MORE CONVENIENT AND MORE ORNATE  THERE WERE NO WOMEN IN THE CASTLE  BUT IT WAS SERVED BY CHILDREN OF AGREEABLE FACES    ONLY ONE OF THE BRIGANDS ASKED FOR PERMISSION TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY  TO BE INTRODUCED TO IT TO CARRY OUT THE ORDERS HIS CAPTAIN HAD CHARGED HIM  HE WAS A VERY YOUNG MAN  WHOSE SAD FACE  BUT GENTLE AND MODEST  WOULD HAVE INSPIRED IN ANY OTHER PLACE TRUST AND INTEREST  HE CAME TO LEARN HOW TO ANTONIA THAT HER BOAT HAD ONLY BEEN ATTACKED BY THE MORE FATAL  THAT NOTHING SHE OWNED WOULD BE REMOVED  THAT SHE HERSELF WAS FREE IN DUINO  THAT SHE DID NOT HAVE CEASED TO BE  THAT EVERYTHING WAS READY FOR HIS TRIP  AND THAT HE IT WAS UP TO HER ALONE TO HASTEN OR DELAY IT  DEPENDING ON WHETHER HIS HEALTH WOULD DEMAND IT  THAT IN THE MEANTIME  FINALLY  SHE COULD TO RULE AS SOVEREIGN OVER ALL WHO LIVED IN THE CASTLE     BUT MY SISTER    CRIED ANTONIA      YOUR SISTER  MADAME    REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN  LOWERING HIS EYES    CANNOT BE RETURNED TO YOU  IT IS THE ONLY RESERVE THAT WE LET US BE OBLIGED TO PUT TO OUR OBEDIENCE  AND THIS CONDITION EVEN IS NOT IMPOSED BY A FORCE THAT DEPENDS ON US      AND WHO COULD IMPOSE IT    REPLIED ANTONIA QUICKLY    WHO WOULD PREVENT ME FROM REUNITING WITH MY SISTER  WHO WAS ARRESTED  KIDNAPPED  DRIVEN HERE WITH ME  AH  I DON T WANT ANY OF THE BENEFITS  NONE OF THE REPAIRS YOU OFFER ME  IF I DON T SHARING WITH HER      MADAME    SAID THE YOUNG MAN  BOWING    I HAVE NOT RECEIVED OTHER INSTRUCTIONS      AND HE WITHDREW WITHOUT WAITING FOR FURTHER ENTREATIES    THE NAME OF MADAME ALBERTI STILL WANDERED ON ANTONIA S LIPS PROHIBITED  HE WAS NOT HEARD    THE PERPLEXITY IN WHICH SHE REMAINED IMMERSED IS EASIER TO UNDERSTAND THAT TO DESCRIBE  SHE WAS BEGINNING TO HOPE THAT THIS EVENT WOULD NOT HAVE THE DREADFUL CONSEQUENCES THAT IT HAD CAUSED TO FEAR  BUT SHE DID NOT GUESS THE MOTIVES THAT ONE COULD HAVE TO KEEP HER AWAY FROM HER SISTER  AND THIS NEW MYSTERY WAS A ABYSS WHERE HIS MIND WANDERED  EVERYTHING PERSUADED HIM BESIDES THAT SHE HAD NOT BEEN DECEIVED BY FALSE PROMISES  THE SUN HAD BEEN LYING FOR SEVERAL HOURS  AND ITS DOORS REMAINED OPEN  THE PEOPLE EMPLOYED TO SERVE HER HAD WITHDRAWN THEMSELVES TO GIVE HIM COMPLETE FREEDOM  INDICATING TO HIM THE PART OF HIS APARTMENT THEY WERE GOING TO OCCUPY AND WHERE THEY AWAITED HIS ORDERS  FINALLY HE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE A SOLDIER IN THE VAST EXPANSE OF CORRIDORS THAT HAD BEEN LIT AS FOR HIM TO OFFER A PASSAGE  AT SOME POINT SHE TOOK THE RESOLUTION TO GO OUT    REASSURED BY EVERYTHING SHE NOTICED  SHE DID NOT HESITATE TO ENTER THE GALLERY LEADING TO HIS BEDROOM AND FOLLOW ITS DETOURS TO THE GRAND STAIRCASE OF THE CASTLE  SHE WENT DOWN WITHOUT OBSTACLES  WALKED WITH EQUAL EASE THROUGH THE VESTIBULE AND THE COURTYARDS  AND REACHED THE DRAWBRIDGE WITHOUT MEETING ANYONE  HE STOOPED AT HIS APPROACH  AS IF SOME MAGICAL POWER HAD INTERPRETED ANTONIA S WISH  AND HASTENED TO OBEY IT  AT NO SOONER HAD SHE LEFT IT BEHIND THAN SHE SAW A CAR TRAVEL BAG READY TO GO  AND GUARDED BY SERVANTS  SHE BELIEVED EVEN ADMIT THAT SHE WAS LOADED WITH LUGGAGE THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN WITH HER ON THE BOAT  AND THE POSTILION S EAGERNESS TO HER APPROACH GAVE HER REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS EXPECTED  SHE INQUIRED  HOWEVER  OF THE DESTINATION OF THIS CAR     APPARENTLY FOR TRIESTE   REPLIED ONE OF THE SERVANTS   BUT FOR SUCH PLACE AS THE SIGNORA ANTONIA DE MONTELEONE PLEASES      IT S ME    REPLIED ANTONIA      WE DID NOT DOUBT IT    SAID THE POSTILION    THERE S NO OTHER WOMEN IN THIS CASTLE  AND WE ARE READY FOR YOU TO OBEY      THERE IS ANOTHER WOMAN IN THIS CASTLE    CRIED ANTONIA       MY SISTER IS IN THIS CASTLE     HAVE YOU NOT BEEN WARNED THAT I WOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY MY SISTER      WE ONLY TALKED ABOUT THE SIGNORA    HE SAID  SHAKING SADLY  THE HEAD    AND THERE IS NO APPEARANCE THAT HIS SISTER CAN COME OUT OF THE CASTLE  IF THIS IS NOT THE INTENTION OF THE OWNER  BUT MADAME MAY NOT KNOW THE OWNER OF THE CH TEAU DE DUINO  CAPTIVE FOR SUCH A SHORT TIME         FORGIVE ME    REPLIED ANTONIA    I KNOW WHERE I AM  IT IS HOWEVER INCOMPREHENSIBLE THAT MY SISTER IS NOT HERE      THE DRAWBRIDGE WAS STILL LOWERED  THE CASTLE WAS ONLY GUARDED BY THE LOOKOUTS OF ITS TOWERS  ANTONIA CAST HER EYES IN INSIDE  AND THOUGHT HER SISTER WAS TRAPPED THERE     I WILL STAY    SHE SAID IN A LOUD VOICE    I WILL NOT LEAVE WITHOUT HER  AND HER DESTINY WILL BE MINE      AS SHE SPOKE THESE WORDS  SHE HAD QUICKLY GONE THROUGH A PART OF THE SPACE THAT SEPARATED IT FROM THE GRAND STAIRCASE  SHE IS RETURNED TO SEE IF SHE WAS BEING FOLLOWED  THE DRAWBRIDGE IS RAISED  IN THIS ASPECT HIS COURAGE WEAKENS  IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT EVERYTHING WAS ENDING  AND THAT SHE HAD JUST RAISED BETWEEN HERSELF AND THE WORLD A BARRIER THAT SHE WOULD NOT CROSS  SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE HERSELF SUDDENLY TRANSPORTED IN THE MIDDLE OF A WILD FOREST  AT THE MERCY THE FIERCEST ANIMALS  DURING ONE OF THE HARSHEST NIGHTS OF WINTER  BUT STILL FREE AND MISTRESS OF ITSELF  THE WALLS OF THE CASTLE WEIGHED ON HER  ON THE AIR SHE BREATHED  AND HER COMPRESSED HEART WAS ABOUT TO BURST IN HER BOSOM  SHE APPROACHED OF THE BALUSTRADE TO LEAN AND TO CATCH BREATH  HIS EYES WERE TURNED TOWARDS A WINDOW FROM WHICH A WEAK LIGHT THAT CAME TO TREMBLE AT HIS FEET  AFTER A FEW MOMENTS OF VAGUE AND INVOLUNTARY ATTENTION  SHE THOUGHT SHE SEIZED SINGULAR NOISES WHICH ALSO CAME FROM THE UNDERGROUND PASSAGES OF THE CASTLE  AND WHICH REMINDED HIS MIND OF THE SOLEMNITY OF CERTAIN SONGS RELIGIOUS  AT FIRST SHE JUDGED THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE BELLOW OF THE SEA BREAKING AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN  BUT THESE NOISES ONLY ARRIVED AT HER AT INTERVALS  SOMETIMES THEY EVEN SEEMED QUITE STOPPED  AND ANTONIA WAS APPROACHING MEASURED FROM THE WINDOW WITH UNEASY CURIOSITY  THEY FINALLY STRUCK MORE DIRECTLY  TO THE POINT WHERE SHE IMAGINED DISCERN ARTICULATE SOUNDS AND THE VERY NAME OF HIS SISTER  CONVINCED THAT THE PREOCCUPATION OF HIS MIND MIGHT HAVE PRODUCED THIS ILLUSION  SHE KNELT ON THE EDGE OF THE WINDOW  AND HOLDING BACK HIS BREATHING SO AS NOT TO LOSE THE SLIGHTEST NOISE THAT STIRRED THE AIR  SHE HEARD IT AGAIN     MY SISTER IS HERE   SHE SAID ALOUD  UNABLE TO MODERATE THE FEELING WHICH ABSORBED ALL HIS IDEAS  WHICH PENETRATED ALL HIS SENSE OF AN INCONCEIVABLE MIXTURE OF JOY AND TERROR    SHE GOT UP HASTILY  AND RUSHED DOWN AN EVIL RAMP ILLUMINATED WHICH WAS TO LEAD IT TO THE UNDERGROUND PASSAGES OF THE CASTLE  AFTER COUNTLESS DETOURS INDICATED FROM SPACE TO SPACE BY PALE LAMPS HIDDEN IN THE HOLLOWS OF THE WALL  IT SLOWS DOWN HER WALK  BECAUSE THE NOISE THAT HAD ATTRACTED HER WAS CLOSE SO AS NOT TO LET HER LOSE A WORD  BUT SHE HEARD MADAME ALBERTI S NAME NO LONGER  IT WAS ONLY  LIKE SHE HAD ASSUMED IT  A SONG LIKE CHURCH SONGS  WHICH WAS SUNG BY A SINGLE VOICE AND REPEATED IN CHORUS  SOON  SHE ARRIVED AT THE VERY PLACE OF THE CEREMONY  AND  FROZEN WITH FEAR  SHE SLIPPED LIKE A SPECTER BETWEEN THE TALL COLUMNS WHICH SUPPORTED THE VAULT AT A PRODIGIOUS HEIGHT  HIDDEN IN THE SHADOWS CAST IN THE DISTANCE BY THEIR ENORMOUS BASES  ALL OF THESE COLUMNS LOADED WITH BUNDLES OF SPEARS  SCIMITARS AND WEAPONS FIRE  FORMED A KIND OF FOREST THROUGH WHICH ONE CANNOT COULD ONLY VAGUELY DISTINGUISH WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE CENTER OF THIS UNDERGROUND ROOM    ANTONIA  ELATED BY HER ATTACHMENT TO HER SISTER  ARMED HERSELF WITH MORE AND MORE OF A RESOLUTION HITHERTO FOREIGN TO ITS CHARACTER  WHENEVER THE UNITED VOICES FILLED THE ECHOES OF A PROLONGED NOISE THAT COULD COVER THE SOUND OF HIS FOOTSTEPS  SHE FLEW FROM ONE COLUMN TO ANOTHER  AND WAITED  TO DARE TO TURN HIS EYES ON THE ENCLOSURE  THAT THE UNIVERSAL SILENCE WHICH THERE SUCCEEDED FROM TIME TO TIME  AND THAT ITS APPEARANCE WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY TROUBLED  PROVED TO HIM THAT SHE HAD NOT BEEN SEEN    HOWEVER  THE DELICACY OF HIS SIGHT DID NOT ALLOW HIM TO DISTINGUISH OBJECTS AS IF THEY HAD BEEN INTERCEPTED BY A CLOUD  AND THE VAGUENESS THAT HIS IMAGINATION GAVE TO THEIR SHAPES UNCERTAINLY INCREASED THE TERROR OF THIS NOCTURNAL SCENE    ON THE SIDE OPPOSITE TO THE ENTRANCE TO THE UNDERGROUND  ROSE A LONG SERIES OF ANGULAR ARCHES WHOSE POINTS WERE LOST IN THE DARKNESS OF THE VAULT  AND WHICH WERE ONLY SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER BY OTHER GROUPS OF THIN COLUMNS  BLACKENED AND WORN BY THE TIME  MOURNING HANGINGS CUT THESE ARCADES AT A CERTAIN ELEVATION  AND THE BRIGANDS SCATTERED OVER THE BOTTOM OF THIS FUNERAL DECORATION ADDED TO ITS MYSTERIOUS HORROR  EACH  MOTIONLESS AND COLLECTED  SEATED AT THE BACK OF THE STALLS DUG IN THE MASSIVE COLUMNS  AND THAT WE WOULD HAVE TAKEN FOR FIGURES SINISTER ARRANGED BY AN ATRABILAR SCULPTOR  THESE  STANDING AROUND THE IRON CANDELABRA  AND FANNING WITH THEIR DAGGERS THE FLAME OF TORCHES AND BRAZIERS  THOSE WHO GOT LOST IN THE NIGHT OF THE DISTANT PORTICOES  AND WHICH  THROUGH THE DARKNESS MOBILES FROM WHICH DARKENED AND EMERGED IN TURN THEIR FROWNING HEADS AND BUSHY BEARDS  LOOKED LIKE SO MANY GHOSTS  AMONG THEM  THERE WAS ONE ESPECIALLY WHOSE SINGULAR ATTITUDE EXCITED THE ATTENTION ALL THE MORE ANTONIA  WHOM SHE SOON JUDGED TO BE UNHAPPY AND SENSITIVE  HIS FACE WAS WRAPPED IN A CREPE THAT HID IT ENTIRELY  KNEELING ON THE FIRST STEPS OF A PLATFORM THE REST OF WHICH HID FROM THE SIGHT OF ANTONIA  HE WAS LEANING ON THE HILT OF HIS SABER AND WEPT BITTERLY  THE SOUND OF HIS SOBS ALONE INTERRUPTED THE FIRM AND SUSTAINED VOICE OF THE PRIEST WHO PRESIDED OVER THE SACRIFICE  ANTONIA  BESIDE HERSELF AND PRESSED BY INVINCIBLE CURIOSITY  MADE A MOVEMENT TO SEE THE ALTAR  IT WAS A FUNERAL BED  AND ON THIS BED A WOMAN LYING  HER HEAD RAISED ON A BLACK VELVET CUSHION  AND HARDLY DISFIGURED BY RECENT TRACES OF DEATH      MY SISTER  ANTONIA CRIED  AND SHE FELL    IT WAS SHE INDEED  BECAUSE THE SHOT FIRED AT THE BOAT HAD KILLED HER  AND JEAN SBOGAR S TROOP RETURNED THE LAST HONORS      XV  WHY DO YOU BRISTLE LIKE THIS  LOOKING AT ME  YOUR HAIR BLOODY  WHY DO YOU TURN ON ME THOSE EYES WHOSE APPLE DRIED OUT HAS DISAPPEARED FROM ITS ORBIT  IT WASN T ME WHO KILLED YOU   SHAKESPEARE    WILL I FIND YOU EVERYWHERE  SHADOWS OF THE MURDERED  WITH YOUR LARGE LIVID WOUNDS  AND YOU  WEEPING MOTHERS  WHO SHOW ME THESE FLAMES LIT BY MY HANDS  THESE FLAMES WHOSE TONGUES HORRIBLE DEVOUR THE CRADLE OF YOUR FIRSTBORNS   SCHILLER    ANTONIA REMAINED FOR A LONG TIME BURIED IN A STATE WHICH RESEMBLED SLEEP  SHE DID NOT SEEM TO EXPERIENCE ANY AGITATION  AND THIS CALM WAS SO DEEP  IT HAD TO MAKE ROOM TO ALL APPEARANCES SO DEADLY ANGUISH THAT ONE TREMBLED TO SEE IT CEASE  HOWEVER  SHE CAME TO HERSELF WITHOUT SHOWING ANY PAIN  ALL AT MORE  SHE SEEMED OCCUPIED WITH AN UNFORTUNATE IDEA  A MEMORY UNWELCOME  WHOM SHE WAS TRYING TO DRIVE AWAY  SHE LOOKED AROUND AROUND HER UNCERTAINLY  AND RAN HER HAND OVER HER FOREHEAD TO SEEK TO REALIZE A WORRYING DOUBT    I KNOW VERY WELL    SHE SAID AT LAST    I KNOW WHERE SHE IS  I HAVE IT WILL MEET AGAIN THIS EVENING      FITZER  THE YOUNGEST OF THE BRIGANDS  APPROACHED HER TO INQUIRE ABOUT HIS CONDITION  SHE SMILES AT HIM LIKE A PERSON KNOWN  BECAUSE IT WAS HE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO HER THE DAY BEFORE FROM JEAN SBOGAR     I VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU FOR A LONG TIME   SHE CONTINUED    I WOULD LIKE KNOW FOR WHAT TORTURE YOU PUNISH THE INDISCREET WHO PENETRATE IN YOUR PARTIES WITHOUT HAVING BEEN ASKED  I KNOW A YOUNG GIRL     BUT I RECOMMEND YOU THIS SECRET ON THE SALVATION OF WHAT YOU LIKE THE BEST IN THE WORLD     PROMISE ME NOT TO MENTION IT NEVER TO ANYONE      THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED AT HER  HIS EYES WET WITH TEARS  BECAUSE THAT HE SAW THAT HIS REASON WAS LOST     WAIT   SHE SAID TO HIM IN A TONE OF THE GREATEST SURPRISE  ARE TEARS  I THOUGHT WE WEREN T CRYING ANYMORE  DON T HIDE FROM ME NOT YOUR TEARS  AS FOR ME  I CANNOT SHOW ANY MORE  I MYSELF REMEMBER SEEING ANOTHER MAN  IT WAS IN A PLACE WHERE I WAS NOT EXPECTED  A MAN WHO WAS ALSO CRYING  I THINK THIS COULD BE YOU  FOR HER FACE WAS COVERED WITH A VEIL THAT KEPT ME FROM KNOWING HIM      HIS FEATURES ARE UNKNOWN TO ME AS WELL AS TO YOU    REPLIED FITZER    FEW OF US HAVE SEEN IT OTHER THAN THROUGH THIS VEIL OR THE VISOR OF HIS HELMET  OUR OLD WARRIORS ALONE SAW HIM AT DISCOVERED IN THE FIGHTING  BUT HE VERY RARELY COMES TO DUINO  AND ONLY SEEMS MASKED SINCE WE WALKED SAFELY THE VENETIAN PROVINCES  HE S OUR CAPTAIN      WHERE IS HE    REPLIED ANTONIA COLDLY    SO HE DOESN T KNOW THAT I AM HERE      HE KNOWS IT  BUT HE DOES NOT DARE TO COME BEFORE YOU  FOR FEAR THAT HIS PRESENCE DOES NOT ALARM YOU  AND THAT YOU DO NOT ATTRIBUTE TO HIM THE ERROR THAT CAUGHT YOU CAPTIVE      CAPTIVE  YOU SAY  ANTONIA IS FREER THAN AIR  TONIGHT AGAIN  I WALKED VERY FAR FROM HERE IN THE THICKETS DELICIOUS  WHERE I BREATHED SUCH PURE AIR  I VE NEVER SEEN SO MUCH FLOWERS  MY SISTER WAS THERE WITH ME  SHE WANTED TO STAY THERE  I THERE WENT MORE OFTEN WHEN I WAS YOUNGER  BUT I M NOT THERE NEVER BEEN WITH MY MOM  MY LIFE HAS CHANGED A LOT SINCE THAT TIME      ANTONIA RESTED HER HEAD ON HER HAND  AND HER EYELIDS LOWERED THEMSELVES  HER COMPLEXION WAS ANIMATED WITH DARK COLORS  HER LIPS SEEMED PARCHED WITH A BURNING FEVER  SHE LAUGHED AND SOBBED    ANTONIA S FATE WAS FULFILLED  HE NO LONGER HAD LEFT ON THE LAND OTHER PROTECTION THAN THAT OF THIS FORMIDABLE LOVER WHO HAD SO MYSTERIOUSLY APPEARED AT THE FARNEDO  AND WHO WAS JEAN SBOGAR HIMSELF  THE LOVE OF JEAN SBOGAR WATCHED OVER HER WITH A SOLICITUDE AND WITH A PURITY THAT WOULD NO DOUBT HAVE SURPRISED HER  IF THE DISORDER OF HIS REASON HAD ALLOWED HIM TO REFLECT ON HIS STATE  THEY BROUGHT IN  FROM THE COTTAGES OF SESTIANA  YOUNG WOMEN TO SERVE IT AND TO KEEP IT  FAMOUS DOCTORS WERE CALLED OR KIDNAPPED FROM NEIGHBORING TOWNS TO PROVIDE CARE THAT HIS ILLNESS REQUIRED  A CLERGYMAN  FOR A LONG TIME PRISONER OF THE BRIGANDS  THE ONE WHO HAD JUST CELEBRATED THE SERVICE FUNERAL OF MADAME ALBERTI  IN AN UNDERGROUND PASSAGE THEY HAD CONVERTED INTO A CHAPEL FOR THIS CEREMONY  SPIED ON HIS READS WITH PAIN THE LUCID MOMENTS THAT HIS ILLNESS LEFT HIM  TO BRING HIM THE CONSOLATIONS OF HEAVEN  THESE FIERCE MEN AT LAST  WHOSE SOUL UNTIL THEN HAD CONCEIVED ONLY THOUGHTS OF BLOOD  PURIFIED BY THE ASPECT OF SO MUCH INNOCENCE AND TOUCHED BY SO MUCH OF MISFORTUNE  LAVISHED ON HIM THE MARKS OF SUBMISSION THE MOST DELICATE AND TENDER  ANTONIA GOT USED TO SEEING THEM AND TO ENTERTAIN THEM WITH THE BIZARRE ILLUSIONS WHICH SUCCEEDED EACH OTHER IN HIS SICK IMAGINATION  JEAN SBOGAR  ALONE  DID NOT DARE TO PRESENT TO HER UNDER THE VEIL OR VISOR HELMET WHICH HID HER FEATURES  THAT WHEN SHE WAS DELIVERED TO SLEEP  OR THAT DELIRIUM DEPRIVED HIM OF KNOWLEDGE OF ALL OBJECTS  AND THAT HE COULD FEED HIS EYES WITH PAINFUL CONTEMPLATION LOVED OBJECT  WITHOUT RISKING INSPIRING IT WITH FEAR OR THE HORROR  ONE DAY HOWEVER  PROSTRATE AT HIS FEET AND UNABLE TO CONTAIN THE FEELINGS THAT OPPRESSED HIM     ANTONIA    HE CRIED IN A VOICE CHOKED BY SOBS    ANTONIA  DEAR ANTONIA      SHE TURNED TO HER SIDE  AND LOOKED AT HIM GENTLY  HE HASTENED TO WALK AWAY  SHE CALLED HIM BACK WITH A SIGN  HE REMAINED  HEAD BENT OVER HIS CHEST  IN THE ATTITUDE OF OBEDIENCE AND ATTENTION     ANTONIA    SHE SAID AFTER A MOMENT OF SILENCE    I THINK IT IS INDEED MY NAME  I WORE IT IN THE HOUSE WHERE I AM BORN  AND THEN I WAS PROMISED TO BE HAPPY  LISTEN    SHE CONTINUED  TAKING THE THIEF S HAND    I WANT TO MAKE YOU A CONFIDENCE  FROM THE TIME OF MY EARLY YOUTH  WHEN I BELIEVED THAT IT WAS SO EASY AND SO SWEET TO LIVE  WHEN MY BLOOD WAS NOT BURNING NOT MY VEINS  WHEN MY TEARS DID NOT BURN MY CHEEKS  WHEN I DID NOT SEE SPIRITS RUNNING THROUGH THICKETS  WHO OPEN THE EARTH BY STRIKING IT WITH THEIR FEET  WHICH DIG ABYSSES DEEPER THAN THE SEA  AND WHICH CAUSE SOURCES OF FIRE  WHEN THE SOULS OF ASSASSINS WHO HAVE NOT ASYLUM IN THE TOMB DID NOT YET COME AROUND ME LEAP AND RUSH WITH CRUEL LAUGHTER  AND WHEN I WAKE UP I DIDN T HAVE TO UNTIE THE VIPER ENTWINED IN MY HAIR  THE VIPER WHOSE FOAMING HEAD WITH A BLUISH POISON RESTED ON MY NECK     AT THAT TIME THERE WAS AN ANGEL TRAVELING ON THE EARTH WITH FEATURES THAT WOULD HAVE MOVED

SLAUGHTER HER CHILD  TO MAKE HIMSELF DEAF TO HIS MOANS    HELLO TO THE BRIDE OF JEAN SBOGAR           AS SHE FINISHED THESE WORDS  ANTONIA LOST CONSCIOUSNESS  THIS CRISIS WAS LONG AND TERRIBLE  FOR A LONG TIME PEOPLE EVEN DESPAIRED OF THEIR LIVES  DURING EIGHT DAYS  THE LEADER OF THE THIEVES  MOTIONLESS AT THE FOOT OF THE BED WHICH SHE WAS LYING DOWN  ATTENTIVE TO ALL HER MOVEMENTS  HAD TAKEN CARE OF NO OTHER CARE THAN TO SERVE HER  HE WAS WATCHING AND WAS CRYING    WHEN ANTONIA S CONDITION IMPROVED  CERTAIN THAT SHE WAS FAMILIAR WITH HIS APPEARANCE  AND THAT SHE SAW HIM WITHOUT FEAR  HE WAS STILL AWAKE   THIS ASSIDUITY STRUCK HER   THE REMINISCENCES SHE HAD OF THE PAST WERE TOO CONFUSED SO THAT THE NAME OF THIS MAN AND THE MEMORIES THAT WERE THERE TIED UP INSPIRED HIM WITH A CONTINUOUS FEELING OF HORROR  TIME IN TIME ONLY  HIS SOUL REVOLTED AGAINST THE IDEA OF   DEPENDING OF HIM  AND HIS VERY APPROACH FROZE HER WITH TERROR  BUT MORE USUALLY ABANDONED LIKE A CHILD  BY THE ABSENCE OF HER REASON  AT THE SOLE INSTINCT OF HER NEEDS  SHE NO LONGER SAW  IN THE CAPTAIN OF THE DUINO BANDITS  A SENTIENT CREATURE AND COMPASSIONATE PERSON WHO TRIED TO SOFTEN THE BITTERNESS OF HER SUFFERINGS  AND WHO EAGERLY WARNED HIS LEAST NEEDS  SO SHE SPOKE SOFT WORDS TO HIM AND FLATTERING  WHICH SEEMED TO REDOUBLE THE SECRET PAIN WITH WHICH HE WAS DEVOURED    ONE DAY  AMONG OTHERS  HE WAS SITTING NEXT TO HER  VEILED NEXT ITS USE  AND CAREFUL TO PROTECT ITS SLEEP AGAINST ALL ACCIDENTS THAT COULD DISTURB HIM  SHE WOKE UP HOWEVER SUDDENLY WITH A SHARP MOVEMENT  PRONOUNCING THE NAME OF LOTHARIO     I SAW HIM    SHE SAID WITH A DEEP SIGH    HE WAS SIT IN YOUR PLACE  I OFTEN SEE IT THERE IN MY SLEEP  AND I FIND VERY HAPPY  BUT HOW COME I BELIEVE THE Y ALSO SOMETIMES WHEN I AM AWAKE  AND WHEN HE SEEM LIKE I M NOT DREAMING  IT IS THERE  UNDER THIS CURTAIN  THAT HE HAS WONT TO COME    IN THESE DAYS OF PAIN       AND HOPE  WHERE I FELT CALLED TO ETERNAL FREEDOM  A STREAM OF FLAMES RAN THROUGH ALL MY LIMBS  MY MOUTH WAS FIERY  MY BLUE AND BRUISED NAILS    EVERYTHING HERE WAS FULL OF GHOSTS    WE SAW BRIGHT GREEN ASPICS  LIKE THOSE HIDE IN THE TRUNK OF WILLOWS  OTHER REPTILES MUCH MORE HIDEOUS  WHO HAVE A HUMAN FACE  DISPROPORTIONATE GIANTS AND WITHOUT SHAPES  NEWLY FALLEN HEADS  WHOSE EYES FULL OF LIFE PENETRATED ME WITH A FRIGHTFUL LOOK  AND YOU  YOU WERE TOO STANDING IN THE MIDST OF THEM  LIKE THE MAGICIAN WHO PRESIDED OVER ALL THESE ENCHANTMENTS OF DEATH     I CRIED OUT IN TERROR  AND I CALLED LOTHARIO TO PROTECT ME     SUDDENLY   DON T LAUGH AT MY CHIMERA    I SAW THIS VEIL FALL  AND  IN THE PLACE WHERE YOU WERE PLACED  I SAW LOTHARIO ALL IN TEARS  STRETCHING TOWARDS ME HIS ARMS TREMBLING  AND WHO CALLED ME IN A MOANING VOICE       IT IS TRUE THAT IT WAS NOT HIM AS I KNEW HIM  SAD  ANXIOUS AND SEVERE  BUT BEAUTIFUL WITH A CELESTIAL KINDNESS  FACT  LIVID  FRIGHTENED  HIS BLOODY EYES TURNED  HIS BEARD WAS THICK AND HIDEOUS  A DESPERATE LAUGHTER  LIKE THAT OF DEMONS  WANDERED OVER HIS PALE LIPS     OH  YOU WOULD NEVER DESIGN THIS WHAT HAS BECOME OF LOTHARIO          THE THIEF DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE HEARD ANTONIA  HE WAS IMMERSED IN DEEP SILENCE  HE GOT UP AND WALKED INTO THE BEDROOM NOT RUSHED  THEN HE CAME BACK TO ANTONIA AND LOOKED AT HER LONG TIME  HIS TEETH CLASHED VIOLENTLY  MEDITATION HORRIBLE SEEMED TO OCCUPY HIM ENTIRELY TO THE POINT OF NOT EVEN LET HIM DISCERN THE EVER INCREASING DREAD HE INSPIRED TO HIS UNFORTUNATE PRISONER    FINALLY SHE GOT UP ON HER BED  MANAGED TO SUPPORT HERSELF ON HER KNEES  AND CRIED TO HIM  HANDS CROSSED IN PRAYER    GRACE  GRACE  FORGIVE ME  DO NOT FEAR LOTHARIO  HE     NOT DOES NOT WANT ANTONIA  I GAVE MYSELF TO HIM  AND HE REFUSED ME    THANKS AGAIN FOR THIS ONCE  AND I LL NEVER TELL YOU ABOUT IT      THEN SHE FELL BACK  FOR HER STRENGTH WAS EXHAUSTED  JEAN SBOGAR FLEW TO HIS FEET  GRABBED THE END OF THE BLANKET THAT ENVELOPED IT AND WHICH FLOATED TO THE GROUND  IMPRINTED ITS MOUTH THERE WITH FURY  AND FLED      XVI   STRENGTH OF THE WARRIOR  WHAT ARE YOU  TODAY YOU RIDE THE BATTLE BEFORE YOU IN CLOUDS OF DUST  YOUR STEPS ARE STREWN OF DEAD  AS WITHERED LEAVES MARK IN THE NIGHT THE ROAD OF A SPECTER  TOMORROW THE MOMENTARY DREAM OF BRAVERY IS FINISHED  WHAT TERRIFIED THOUSANDS OF MEN HAS DISAPPEARED  THE MIDGE  CARRIED ON ITS SMOKE COLORED WINGS  SINGS ON THE LET US SHRUB ITS HYMN OF TRIUMPH  AND INSULT YOUR GLORY WHICH IS NOT MORE THAN AN EMPTY WORD   OSSIAN    ANTONIA HAD LIVED LIKE THIS FOR TWO MONTHS AMONG THE BRIGANDS OF DUINO  WITHOUT HIS CONDITION HAVING CHANGED  WITHOUT HIS HAVING GIVEN HOPE  SHE HAD ONLY REGAINED SOME STRENGTH  AND SHE LIKED TO COME AND BREATHE THE EVENING AIR AT HER WINDOW ON THE SEA    ONE DAY  NONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO SERVED HER HAD APPEARED OF HER  IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THIS HAD HAPPENED  BUT SHE DOESN T BARELY NOTICED  THE SOUND OF THE CANNON ROARING AROUND DUINO OCCUPIED HIM MORE  BECAUSE THE EMOTION HE CAUSED HIM WAS OFTEN REPEATED  DESIRING TO SEE HER COMPANIONS  SHE WENT DOWNSTAIRS THE GRAND STAIRCASE  WENT THROUGH THE HALLS AND VESTIBULES  AND FOUND THE CASTLE DESERTED  THE CANNON WAS GETTING CLOSER  AND EACH SHOT WAS FOLLOWED BY A RUMOR SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE STORM  ANTONIA WENT UPSTAIRS  OPENED HER WINDOW AND LOOKED AT THE SEA  LARGE NUMBER OF SMALL VESSELS OR NACELLES SIMILAR TO THOSE FISHERMEN  WHO SEEMED TO SURROUND THE FOOT OF THE FORTRESS    ALL THESE IMPRESSIONS WERE QUITE VIVID AT FIRST  BUT THEY QUICKLY FADED AWAY  NIGHT HAD FALLEN  THE AIR WAS SERENE  THE CALM WAVES  THE SKY POPULATED WITH MYRIADS SHINING STARS  AS IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BOAT D ANTONIA HAD BEEN ARRESTED ON THE ISTRIAN COAST ON LEAVING LAGOONS  SHE TOOK PLEASURE IN LOOKING AT HIM FOR SOME TIME    HOWEVER THE NOISE SHE HAD HEARD INCREASED BEHIND HER IN A THREATENING WAY  SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD HEAR A CLICK OF SWORDS  CURSES  GROANS  WHICH MADE WAY  FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT  TO A DEAD SILENCE  SHE WAS TOO UNHAPPY TO FEAR  IF SHE HAD HAD THE USE OF HER REASON  FOR HIS FATE DID NOT APPEAR LIKELY TO CHANGE FOR THE WORSE  BUT SHE DOES NOT LIVE IN THE DISASTER THAT WAS LOOMING THAT THE DANGER TO SUFFER  AND THE COMPLAINTS THAT HIT HIS EAR GAVE A TERRIBLE IDEA OF   THE PAINS TO WHICH SHE WAS GOING BE EXPOSED    THE GALLERIES OF THE CASTLE HAD NOT BEEN LIT  AND THE DARKNESS HAD GROWN DEEP  SHE DID  HOWEVER  AND SLIPPED ALONG THE DARK WALLS  FOLLOWING THEM FROM THE HAND  WHEN SHE WAS AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS  SHE LISTENED  LESSONS WERE FULL OF ARMED MEN WHO SPOKE CONFUSEDLY    WE WERE NO LONGER FIGHTING    THE BUTT OF THE RIFLES RESOUNDED ALONE AS THEY FELL ON THE FLAGSTONES OF THE PAVED    SUDDENLY SHE HEARD A HORRIBLE TUMULT  IN THE MIDST OF WHICH AROSE THE NAME OF JEAN SBOGAR  A PURSUED MAN RUSHED INTO THE STAIRS  AND PASSED HER LIKE LIGHTNING  A FEW TORCHES BEGAN TO SHINE ON THE FIRST FEW STEPS  THE BAYONETS CLASHED  THE STONE STEPS RESOUNDED UNDER THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE SOLDIERS  ANTONIA RAN TO HER ROOM  AND  IN Y RETURNING HOME  IT SEEMED TO HER THAT SHE WAS BEING NAMED IN A HOLLOW VOICE       WHO S CALLING ME    SHE SAID  TREMBLING      IT IS I    REPLIED JEAN SBOGAR    DO NOT BE AFRAID  FAREWELL FOREVER      HE HAD APPROACHED THE WINDOW  AND ALREADY THE TROOPS WHO WERE HIS RESEARCH FILLED THE OPPOSITE END OF THE GALLERY    THE THIEF CAME BACK TO ANTONIA  AND GRABBED HER     IT S ME  IT S ME   HE SAID    GOODBYE FOREVER      ANTONIA FELT A VAGUE FEELING OF HORROR AND TENDERNESS THAT SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND    SBOGAR SHUDDERED    HE PRESSED HER WITH ONE OF HIS ARMS TO HIS HEART     ANTONIA  DEAR ANTONIA    HE CRIED    GOODBYE FOREVER  OH  FOR THE LAST TIME  MORE THAN THIS MINUTE IN ALL CENTURIES  ANTONIA  DEAR ANTONIA      HER VEIL HAD FALLEN  BUT ANTONIA COULD NOT SEE HER FACE  SHE WAS TOUCHING HIM  SHE HAD FELT THE FIRE OF HIS BREATH  THE SAME INSTANT THE THIEF S LIPS CLUNG TO HIS  AND THEIR IMPRINTED A KISS WHICH SPREAD IN ANTONIA S SENSES A UNKNOWN INTOXICATION  A DEVOURING PLEASURE WHICH PARTOOK OF THE SKY AND FROM HELL      PROFANATION OR SACRILEGE    SAID SBOGAR    YOU ARE MY MISTRESS AND  MY WIFE  AND MAY THE WORLD PERISH NOW      SPEAKING THESE WORDS  HE SET HER DOWN ON THE HIGH STEP THAT CLIMBED UP TO THE WINDOW  AND RUSHED INTO THE SEA    THE SOLDIERS HAD ARRIVED WITH THEIR TORCHES  THEY WERE ASTONISHED NOT TO SEE THE THIEF  AND ASKED ANTONIA IF SHE HAD PREVIEW     PEACE    SHE SAID TO THEM  APPLYING HER FINGER TO HER MOUTH    HE WAS THE FIRST TO GO TO THE NUPTIAL BED    AND THERE YOU GO    SHE CONTINUED SHOWING THE PANCAKE HE HAD LEFT FEET   HERE IS HER WEDDING PRESENT        XVII   THE ONE WHOM THE ANGEL THEN SHOWED ME WAS MOUNTED ON A PALE HORSE  AND DRAGGED ALL THE LIVING AFTER HIM  IT WAS CALLED DEATH   APOCALYPSE    FRENCH TROOPS HAD JUST ENTERED THE PROVINCES VENETIAN  THE FIRST CARE OF THE GENERALS WAS TO PURGE THIS COUNTRY BRIGANDS WHO INFESTED IT  AND WHO COULD BECOME FOR A THE MOST FORMIDABLE AUXILIARY OPPOSING ARMY  IT IS THIS PATTERN THAT HAD DETERMINED THE ATTACK ON DUINO CASTLE  ALMOST ALL THE BANDITS PERISHED WITH WEAPONS IN HAND  WE COULD NOT HAVE ALIVE THAT A SMALL NUMBER OF THEM  THAT SERIOUS INJURIES WERE COMING TO PUT OUT OF ACTION OR WHICH HAD RUSHED INTO THE SEA  AND WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN COLLECTED BY THESE PODS THAT ANTONIA HAD OBSERVED  IT WAS ASSUMED THAT JEAN SBOGAR WOULD BE AMONG THEM  BUT AS HIS FEATURES WERE NOT KNOWN TO BRIGANDS THEMSELVES  NOTHING COULD FIX ON THIS POINT THE DOUBTS OF THEIR WINNERS  FITZER  ZISKA AND MOST OF THE LEADING CAPTAIN  WERE DEAD BY HIS SIDE BEFORE HE ENTERED THE CASTLE    THE PRISONERS WERE SENT TO MANTUA TO BE TRIED THERE  WE PREFERRED THIS RATHER REMOTE TOWN TO ANY OTHER  BECAUSE IT PUT THEM OUT OF THE REACH AND ATTEMPTS OF THEIR ACCOMPLICES  AND THAT HER HAPPY MILITARY POSITION DEFENDED HER A HELPING HAND  ANTONIA WAS DRIVEN THERE IN A CAR SEPARATE  HER STATE OF DEMENTIA BEING OBVIOUS  SHE WAS CONFIDED IN A HOSPITAL IN THE CARE OF A DOCTOR FAMOUS FOR THE PROGRESS THAT HE HAD DONE FOR THE KNOWLEDGE AND TREATMENT OF THIS SAD ILLNESS    HIS EFFORTS WERE CROWNED WITH DISASTROUS SUCCESS  ANTONIA HEALS  AND UNDERSTOOD THE FULL EXTENT OF HIS MISFORTUNE    DURING THE TIME SHE HAD SPENT IN THIS HOUSE  SHE DID NOT CEASED TO BE THE OBJECT OF THOSE PIOUS SOLICITATIONS WHOSE RELIGION ONLY CHARITY CAN TEACH THE SECRET  AS SHE GETS THERE WAS MADE KNOWN  AND HIS MIND CLEARED OF THE DARKNESS THAT OBSCURED IT HAD TAKEN UP THIS BINDING CHARM WHICH CHAINS THE HEART  SHE HAD EXCITED AROUND HER  AND ESPECIALLY AMONG HOLY GIRLS WHO SERVED THIS HOSPICE  A FEELING MORE SWEET AS PITY    SHE WAS LOVED    AS NO AFFECTION RECALLED HER IN THE WORLD  AND THIS PEACEFUL ASYLUM WAS NOW EVERYTHING FOR HER  IT WAS EASY FOR HER TO GET USED TO THE IDEA OF   ENDING YOUR LIFE THERE  A LITTLE LATER SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN FORCED TO DO SO    SOME STEPS TO RETURN TO HIS GREAT POSSESSIONS REMAINED UNNECESSARY  GREEDY COLLATERALS  WHO ARRIVED AFTER THE ARMY  HAD DECLARED THE DEATH OF MME ALBERTI  HAD ASSUMED THE HIS OWN AND SEIZED HIS HERITAGE  THEY WERE POWERFUL  THIS PLUNDER MADE THEM RICH  CLAIMS ANTONIA COULD NOT BE HEARD  SHE WAS NO LONGER IN THE EYES MEN BUT AN ORPHAN WITHOUT NAME AND WITHOUT CONFESSION  THIS WAS THE LEAST OF HIS MISFORTUNES  AND HIS HEART FELT IT ONLY THINKING OF THE GOOD SHE COULD HAVE DONE IN HER NEW KIND OF LIFE IF SHE HAD BROUGHT THERE THE RESOURCES OF OPULENCE  HIS JEWELRY WAS AT LEAST SUFFICIENT FOR HER DOWRY AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF ALMS WHICH WERE TO MAKE KNOWN TO THE POOR THAT HE WAS ONE MORE BENEFACTRESS CAME TO THE SAINTE MARIE HOSPITAL    THE DAY OF HIS PROFESSION  LONG DELAYED BECAUSE OF ITS EXTREME WEAKNESS  HAD FINALLY ARRIVED  WHEN TWO HENCHMEN CAME TO CALL HER IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE    THE INVESTIGATION OF THE TRIAL OF THE BRIGANDS WAS COMPLETED  THEY HAD WERE SENTENCED TO DEATH  FORTY IN NUMBER  BUT NOTHING PROVED THAT JEAN SBOGAR WAS AMONG THEM  AND THE TERROR OF THIS NAME FORMIDABLE STILL HOVERED OVER THE VENETIAN PROVINCES  WHERE IT ALONE COULD RALLY NEW BANDS AS DANGEROUS AS THE FIRST    IN THIS UNCERTAINTY  WE REMEMBERED THE MAD GIRL WHO HAD BEEN FOUND AT DUINO CASTLE  AND THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE AGREED TO PRESENT AS THE ONLY OBJECT THAT HAD EVER TOUCHED THE IMPLACABLE FEROCITY OF JEAN SBOGAR  WE THOUGHT SHE DID WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY RECOGNIZE AMONG HIS ACCOMPLICES IF HE WAS WITH THEM  AND THAT HIS FIRST MOVEMENT WOULD INDICATE IT IN A WAY CERTAIN  THAT S WHY WE THOUGHT IT APPROPRIATE TO DO IT PLACE IN THE GREAT COURTYARD OF THE PRISONS  WHEN THE CONDEMNED WOULD GO THERE FOR THE LAST TIME    ANTONIA WAS DRESSED IN HER NOVITIATE HABIT  HER HAIR WERE ALREADY TIED UNDER THE BLINDFOLD OF VIRGINS  WHOSE COMPLEXION PALE ERASED THE WHITENESS  TWO HOSPITABLE SISTERS ACCOMPANIED HIM  ALMOST UNABLE TO SUPPORT HERSELF  SHE WAS LEANING ON THE ARM OF ONE OF THEM  HIS HAND WAS FIXED ON THE OTHER S SHOULDER  AND HIS HEAD FELL ON HIS CHEST    SOON A STRANGE NOISE WAS HEARD  IT WAS THE EXCLAMATION OF A HORRIBLE IMPATIENCE WHICH FINALLY SAW ITSELF SATISFIED  SHE LOOKED UP AND THOUGHT HE SAW SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY  BUT HER SIGHT DID HER BADLY  A JUDICIAL OFFICER WHO DOES SAW HER MADE HER TAKE A FEW STEPS FORWARD  SHE SAW MORE DISTINCTLY  WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT SHE WAS SEEING  THEY WERE MEN WHOSE HIDEOUS COSTUME GRIEVED HER WITH TERROR  AND WHO ADVANCED IN A SINGLE LINE IN FRONT OF A LINE OF SOLDIERS  THEIR STEPS WERE MEASURED  THEIR STATIONS FREQUENT  TO EACH OF THEM SHE FELT HER DREADFUL ANXIETY GROWING  FINALLY SHE WAS STRUCK WITH A FRIGHTFUL ILLUSION  AND THOUGHT TO FALL PREY TO DELIRIUM FROM WHICH SHE HAD JUST BEEN SAVED    IT WAS HIM    IT WAS THIS PAINTING THAT HAD INSPIRED HIM WITH SUCH DEEP TERROR IN VENICE  WHEN LOTHARIO S HEAD APPEARED IN A MIRROR ABOVE OF HIS RED SCHALL   SHE STEPPED FORWARD ON HER OWN TO CONVINCE OR TO UNDECEIVE HER EYES  HIS PHYSIOGNOMY HAD THE SAME CHARACTER  HE WAS WRAPPED A DRESS OR COAT OF THE SAME COLOR    IT WAS HIM   LOTHARIO  SHE CRIED IN A HEARTBREAKING VOICE  RUSHING TOWARDS HIM    LOTHARIO TURNED AWAY AND RECOGNIZED HER     LOTHARIO   SHE SAID  OPENING A PASSAGE THROUGH THE SABERS AND BAYONETS  FOR SHE CONCEIVED HE WAS GOING TO DIE     NO  NO    HE REPLIED    I AM JEAN SBOGAR      LOTHARIO  LOTHARIO      JEAN SBOGAR    HE REPEATED FORCEFULLY      JEAN SBOGAR    CRIED ANTONIA    O MY GOD         AND HIS HEART WAS BROKE    SHE WAS ON THE GROUND  MOTIONLESS  SHE HAD STOPPED BREATHING    ONE OF THE MINIONS LIFTED HIS HEAD WITH THE TIP OF HIS SABER  AND HE LET HIT THE PAVEMENT  ABANDONING IT TO ITS WEIGHT     THIS YOUNG GIRL IS DEAD    HE SAID           DEAD    RESUMED JEAN SBOGAR  LOOKING AT HER FIXEDLY    LET S WALK
